Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_1,"The Tethys System recently expanded its frequency feature library and detected a previously unknown, special frequency. In response, the Black Shores dispatched Bloom Bearers to investigate. Valentina informs you that Shorekeeper is now analyzing the abnormal frequency and suggests you meet her for more information."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_2,"Group A, begin data preprocessing. Group B, deploy ground interference neutralizers... Oh, {PlayerName}, you're here."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_3,Why is there such a large gathering today?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_4,"The Black Shores recovered the Threnodian's Gem not long ago... I mean, Leviathan's essence. The Tethys System ran a deep analysis and expanded its frequency feature library. This enhancement allows us to detect previously unidentifiable special frequencies."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_7,Bloom Bearers not assigned to critical duties have been dispatched to investigate. The Shorekeeper is also dedicating part of her computations to tracking it. The Black Shores has classified this as a high-priority operation and is committing additional resources to track and replicate the signal.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_8,That explains the crowd.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_9,"Exactly. None of us can identify this abnormal frequency, so it might lead to new discoveries."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_10,The Shorekeeper is in the Error Cell. You can go there to speak with her.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1_11,"Fortunately, not all these frequencies are Leviathan-related, so there's no immediate risk of Its revival. That said, the closest anomaly is right offshore."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_10_1,Watch out!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_10_2,You... you're the one from before.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_10_3,"This area isn't safe. When the Tacet Discords become crystallized, they become harder to handle... Get down!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1001_8,The Lament is looping. We need to get out of here first.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1002_4,"You said the Lament is ""looping""...? So this has happened before?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1002_5,"Yes. It's like a pair of scissors... slicing Honami City into hopeless, broken pieces."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1003_9,...Just like what you're seeing now.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1003_10,What's happening?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1003_11,They've overlapped from the distortion. Stay close.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_11_1,"As minutes pass, the Lament continues to devastate the city. Tacet Discords run rampant, and the city crumbles around you. With no time to spare, you and the mysterious scissor-wielding girl retreat toward a safe zone."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_11_2,Chisa! Over here! Over here!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_11_4,Drop the loot and follow it!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_11_5,"The next Slice is almost here. I know you have a lot of questions, but hold onto them for now. Just follow me."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_111_6,You're injured.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_111_7,My apologies. I just had to be sure you hadn't turned into one of them.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_111_8,The safe house is just ahead. Come with me.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_111_9,(Steady breathing... No signs of Irideglow crystallization. I can rule out the possibility {Male=he;Female=she}'s one of the Left Behind.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_111_10,(She's the one who came at me when I first dropped into this Sonoro.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_111_11,(So why did she save me this time? And even...)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_111_12,Hm? It's fine. Just scratches. That won't slow me down.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_111_13,"In the safe zone, you and the girl catch your breath. You lean against a wall to steady yourself while she watches you in silence. You meet her gaze, yet her eyes seem to focus just off to the side, leaving you uncertain what she's looking at."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_1,We've arrived. The brawl has ended. Breeze slips through the shutters. Coffee stain dries slow.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_2,"Oh, a Passenger. Welcome aboard."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_4,Thank you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_5,"You're welcome. Like I said, I'm sure you have a lot of questions. But first, please allow us to introduce ourselves."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_6,"Ah Chisa, so formal, as usual. I think {Male=he;Female=she} looks like a good person."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_7,...Then you can handle the introductions.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_8,"Greetings, Passenger. My name is Namipon, the <ano=Mascot>guardian</ano> of Honami. I'm also the one who showed you the way... Mmm, I can tell you're a good soul."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_9,"Hello, Namipon. You're a cute one!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_10,This capybara has a name?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_11,"Hehe, new friends knock like a spring breeze... Oh, I mean, I'm happy you find me cute."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_12,"No, no. I'm not the kind of animal you think I am. I am this city's <ano=Mascot>guardian</ano>."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_13,So of course I have a name. It was given by all who live here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_14,"And this is Chisa. A strong, mysterious..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_15,An ordinary student.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_16,"Sorry again. Things were chaotic when we first met, and I couldn't tell whether or not you were one of the Left Behind... I didn't have time to explain."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_17,"But now, I'm sure. You're just another person pulled into this."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_18,You mean...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_19,Can I ask how you ended up here?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_20,(Answer honestly)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_21,(Refuse to answer)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_22,A rift opened up. A hand came out of it and dragged me in.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_24,A hand from a rift? But why didn't that person escape themselves? Why pull you in instead?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_25,What exactly is this place?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_52,"Before we go any further, I need to know where we really are."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12_53,"You enter a coffeehouse, finally meeting the ""mysterious capybara""—Namipon. It proudly declares itself the city's <ano=Mascot>guardian</ano> and, with great enthusiasm, introduces the girl as Chisa, ""A strong, mysterious… ordinary student."""
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_1,What is it? Do you have any questions for me?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_2,Why did you choose this coffeehouse as a base?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_3,How did you meet Namipon?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_4,How can I leave this Sonoro?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_5,I have nothing else to ask.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_6,"Because of its location. It's well-placed, with passageways on both sides. Ideal for monitoring movement."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_7,"When I first found it, the inside was a cluttered mess. I spent the last two months clearing it out. It's still far from tidy, but it's good enough for rest and shelter."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_8,Has it always just been you and Namipon here?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_9,Yes. It's always just been the two of us.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_10,"But there are still... people in the city. I call them the <ano=Human Reverberations>Left Behind</ano>. They don't realize they're already dead. Still go about their lives, heading to school, waiting for buses, replying to messages... But once they begin to notice something's wrong, their consciousness begins to crumble. Seconds later, they're gone."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_11,"That's why I don't say anything. I pretend they're just ordinary citizens. They never remember me, anyway. Sometimes I help them fix a jammed vending machine or tidy up a messy stall... not for any reason. Just because I'm there."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_12,I don't like watching them disappear like that. It's... unsettling. Like they were never real to begin with.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_14,"Hmm, well..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_15,"After I first found this place and began setting it up, I went out to gather supplies. Then, Namipon appeared."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_16,It knows the city's layout and transport better than anyone. It helped me a lot. But all I could offer in return were a few cups of coffee and some desserts.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_17,Seems like Namipon is easy to please.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_18,Didn't expect Namipon to know so much.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_19,It's an interesting creature. And...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_20,And?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_21,And I think it's even more attached to Honami than I am.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_22,Attached...?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_23,"If that interests you, talk to it. I'm sure Namipon would be happy to chat. It was practically humming the whole time on its way to pick you up."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_25,"I've been looking for an opening. Based on what I've observed, Neon Tower in the center of the city is most likely the key. The frequency there is highly unstable, and it shows the Lament's most severe spatial fracturing. Could be the source... or maybe the endpoint."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_26,"But I can't get close. The space in Honami is twisted and overlapping. I've tried every method I could think of, but I always end up looping back to the same spot."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_27,...Now it's just me. And things don't always go the way I want them to.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_29,I have nothing else to ask.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_30,Why not walk around the coffeehouse and relax a bit? We've still got time before the next Lament hits.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_31,Has the coffeehouse always had this much stuff in it?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_32,"No, not at first. I brought most of it in myself over the past two months."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_33,"I didn't focus on decorations. Durable and low power, that's what mattered. Like that coffee machine over there. It was half broken, but the inner heating pipe still worked. I modified it. Good for a cup of coffee now, at least."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_34,Also rearranged the power grid. Added voltage regulator stabilizers. It may be cobbled together... but it's stronger. Should be able to handle a sudden blackout now.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_35,"...Oh, sorry. Rambled on there. You might not be interested in such things."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12001_36,"It wasn't always like this. There used to be someone else. They caught the misaligned pieces, pointed out the right routes. I made sense of it all... because I had another mind with me."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12002_1,"This sofa has seen some years, but somebody's taken good care of it."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12002_2,That little dip on the left side. Hmm... kinda looks like a capybara butt.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12002_3,I guess Namipon really likes this spot.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12003_1,"The plastic casing's gone a bit yellow. Some scratches here and there, but the drip tray's spotless."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12003_2,"The ""Espresso"" button is too worn to read, but the milk frother knob still looks new. Looks like someone's got a clear taste preference."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12004_1,"*Light, upbeat melody*"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12004_2,"Good afternoon, everyone. You're listening to the city radio, drifting gently beneath the early summer sun. Now for your daily dose of happiness—"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12004_3,"A hundred blind picnic baskets have been scattered across the lush lawns of Central Park by City Hall! Each one holds a surprise: maybe a hand-brewed coffee kit paired with a poetry book, or a handcrafted picnic bag for two sweethearts."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12004_4,A friendly cleaner even let slip that someone found open-air concert tickets tucked in a flowerbed this morning!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12004_5,"Meanwhile, the Geiei Gallery Summer Exhibit is in full swing at Hanakage Underground Street. Rare vintage video tapes are on display, inviting you to take a slow stroll through the long river of history."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12004_7,"And don't forget: today's bus stop announcements are hiding snippets of the song ""Melody in the Rainbow."" The passenger who finds the most will win this month's city tram pass!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12004_8,"Keep your heart tuned to joy, and may your day in Honami be a beautiful one."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12004_9,*A soft outro melody plays*
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_1,"Umm... Hello, Passenger."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_2,No rush. You can finish your Rice Dango first.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_3,Mmm... f-finished. How considerate.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_4,"Is there anything I can help you with, Passenger?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_5,I want to learn about this city.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_6,I want to learn about you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_7,"Ah, Honami City... It's a good place."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_8,"I like it here. Flowers drift by the riverside. A tunnel glows with rainbow light. Even though some of it has changed, I..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_9,"I'm still... fond of it. It's like every time I open my eyes, I already know what the view will be."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_10,"Hmm... I don't remember how I ""woke up."" One day, I just knew this city like the lines of my paw."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_11,"Perhaps they created me? All those people in this city, they built things, opened shops, and lived their lives... In the end, all those little pieces came together. And out came me."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_12,"If you think of it that way, maybe I'm just a strange dream they all had together. Or maybe even... a ghost? Hehe."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_14,"Me? I'm Namipon! A little critter wandering the city, patching things up here and there. I can help you find your way, too."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_15,I know every alley and corner of Honami like the back of my paw. I'll be a good travel buddy. All I ask for is a cup of coffee or a Rice Dango. Well... it's also okay if you don't have anything.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_16,I'll still help. Because helping you means helping everyone in Honami.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_17,"Say, Passenger... will you bring us a new story? Chisa's been stuck in this loop for two whole months. You're the only change we've seen."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_18,That's why... I feel like you might open a new path.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_19,"Ah, but don't worry. If I am a ghost, I'm a nice one. After all, the people who once lived in Honami loved it dearly. Whatever they left behind... must be gentle, too."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12005_20,I'm really looking forward to our journey ahead.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12006_1,"Greetings, <ano=Master>Goshujin-sama</ano>. Is there anything I can do to make your day brighter?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12006_2,Are you... a butler?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12006_3,You look just like Namipon!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12006_5,I'd love to try.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12006_7,"Here you go! Careful, it's hot. If the sweetness isn't just right, just let me know, okay?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12006_9,"That's because I <i>am</i> a Namipon! We're all the same Namipon you know. Just shaped a little differently by people's wishes. But deep down, we're all one and the same."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12006_10,"So, how about a hot cup of our freshly brewed house special?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12006_11,Yes! I manage everything in <ano=Train Conductor>Shashou</ano> Cafe! Would you care for a hot cup of our freshly brewed house special?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12007_1,"Greetings, Passenger! You're just in time! Ta-da! Take this, your very own Namipon Badge!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12007_2,What is it?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12007_3,Why are you giving this to me?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12007_4,"It's something special. Since you're new here, it's only right I lend a hand. Whether you're in trouble or just need to rest your feet, come find me anytime, alright?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12007_5,"So, what do you say? Want to hear more about this badge?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12007_6,Go on!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_33,But don't worry. You're safe here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_34,"This <ano=Shashou Cafe>coffeehouse</ano> is a safe zone I created using my ""clipping"" Forte. The location is ideal and the space stable, so I made it our base of operations."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_35,"Your ""clipping"" Forte?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_36,"Everything has a structure. And with these, I can see how it all fits together."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_37,When I was in the center of the city right before the Lament hit?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_38,"For the past two months, I've lived through countless repeats of the Lament. Time and space keep getting sliced up and rearranged. What you see now—that chaos—is the result."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_39,"It's like the whole city's trapped in amber. The people here are caught in one moment, reliving the same day over and over."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_40,I suspect they're no longer truly alive. Just... residual Reverberations. I call them the <te href=851065>Left Behind</te>.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_41,How long has this been going on?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_42,"I wish I knew. Like you, I'm not from here. I was pulled in by the Lament and trapped in this unfamiliar city."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_43,"By objective measurement, I've been trapped in Honami for two months. But even when I first arrived, this endless loop was already underway."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_44,"So you've only tracked the last two months. To get the full picture, I'll need to talk to someone who's been here longer..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_45,"You're barking up the wrong capybara, Passenger. It's true I'm the guardian of Honami... but by the time I woke up, the city was already like this."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_46,That's right. I asked Namipon before. It doesn't know more about this than us.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_47,"But here's what we do know: After the Lament, Namipon gained a physical form and a will of its own. And as Honami's mascot, it knows the city like the back of its paw. The layout, the pathways. I believe that makes it a pretty reliable partner."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_48,And apparently... it's made itself right at home.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_49,Mind if I take a look around?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_50,Go ahead.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_51,"Inside this Sonoro, time and space are brittle. With enough Resonance Energy, I can trace their ""threads"" and cut through them."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_53,"You're in Honami. A city that was destroyed decades ago. You'll still see its name on bus stop signs, in street ads, and in local textbooks for kids."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_54,"Remember that tall tower? The one in the center of the city? That was <te href=851064>Neon Tower</te>, Honami's tallest communication facility. I once saw a billboard for a radio show there: ""Voices in the Morning, broadcast citywide from Neon Tower."""
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_55,"But its last broadcast wasn't a morning greeting. It was the Lament. Records show that on the day of the disaster, it came pouring out of Neon Tower, wiping Honami off Solaris entirely... and sealing it inside this Sonoro."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_56,That's what I did earlier. I cut through the gaps in space to bring you close to the base.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_12008_57,"Chisa and Namipon share with you the history of Honami City. Though the Lament reduced it to ruins decades ago, its lingering aftereffects also sealed the city within a Sonoro Sphere. Time here remains frozen around when the Lament struck, trapping the city in a repeating loop of its final moments. The coffeehouse where you now stand is a safe zone Chisa created using her ""clipping"" Forte."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_1,An old clock... its hands are still ticking.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_2,Someone I knew left it here. She believed time flowed strangely in this Sonoro. Used timing devices to find a loophole. So I brought it to the base.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_3,Someone you knew? Was she... also from the outside and got pulled into this Sonoro?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_4,"You could say that. I don't know who she is exactly, but she understood this place far better than I do."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_5,"She suspected the Sonoro doesn't just loop. It also has a different inner time flow than the outside world. To test her theory, she took apart countless clocks and logged everything. Even her wristwatch was..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_6,...Her wristwatch?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_10,Whoever pulled me into this Sonoro wore a watch like that.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_11,"...Could it have been her? But why? If she reached you, she found a way to contact the outside. So she did figure it out... Then why didn't she leave? She was always careful. Never acted without calculating the odds."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_12,Unless... she knew that was as far as she could go.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_13,You said she knew a lot. Where is she now?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_14,She's...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_15,In the tower.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_16,"She once told me she suspected the only way to break this loop and reconnect with the real world was through the Lament's source, Neon Tower. The closer you get, the more spatial fractures you see."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_17,"...And the more dangerous it gets. But she went alone. Left only a message. Said she'd use the Tower to find others to help, and I should wait here."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_18,And then?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_19,She never came back.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_20,"After that, I left our previous base and came here, hoping to find her. I kept trying to reach the Tower... but every time, I failed. At the Lament's edge, space splits apart. You might feel closer, but in truth, you're not."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_21,"My ""clipping"" Forte works like slicing a shelter out of earthquake rubble. Slabs structured just right, just enough to hide in. But that's all it does."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_22,It's nothing against the Lament.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_23,Well... I used to be able to open the path to Neon Tower. But...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_24,"During the Lament, my ""existence"" was torn apart once, so I lost that ability. The Honami you see now looks whole, but inside it's been cut into countless tangled paths like Chisa's kirigami."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_25,"To find the right path again, we have to reconnect with the Tower. And that means—"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_26,Finding a frequency that shares its source with the Tower.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_27,"Like this! The <te href=851067>Longings</te> from Honami's <ano=Human Reverberations>Left Behind</ano>. They're what woke me up, and they'll guide us to the Tower."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_28,"No, it's not about ability! You just haven't fully learned to filter out the negative emotions while collecting."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_30,So you collect them... with this bottle?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_31,I'm not afraid. I just think... it's unnecessary.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_35,Then let's move.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_41,Hm? What?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_42,Was it covered in moss?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_43,Maybe she brought me here because she knew that's where you are.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_44,You said she never acted without weighing the odds. It must've been a calculated decision. I'm here because she figured you'd need some help.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_45,"Maybe she couldn't move forward herself. Maybe she got stuck somewhere. But she didn't give up. She kept looking for a breakthrough, and I'm probably part of her plan."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_46,"You don't have to carry this alone. She might've already seen this coming, and now she's waiting for you to catch up. You're not the only one trying to solve this puzzle."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_47,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_48,...Mine would have been better executed.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_49,Namipon and I have been collecting them for a while. It hasn't been easy. My ability... still isn't where it needs to be. But we've managed to rule out some wrong routes. We're narrowing it down.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_50,"For some reason, these Longings resonate with the Tower, the source of the Lament. Namipon believes they can lead us to the right route faster."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_51,"Count me in. The more of us, the faster we can do this."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_52,...Most people's abilities won't protect them from that level of emotional interference. Having you there might only—
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_53,It's not about that. She's just afraid you'll hear the voices and get sucked in too!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_54,"I'll be the judge of that. She chose to bring me here, and that means she believed I could help. Maybe it's time you believed in a new possibility too, Chisa."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13_55,"Inside the coffeehouse, you notice an old clock. Chisa explains that it once belonged to ""someone she knew"" who was obsessed with studying the Sonoro's time patterns. As the conversation unfolds, you learn that this person used to wear a moss-covered watch, the very one on the wrist of the hand that pulled you into this place. But you learn she was last heard heading to Honami City's Neon Tower, in search of an escape. She still hasn't returned.

Within Honami City, space is repeatedly sliced apart by the Lament. According to Chisa and Namipon, the only way to navigate this fragmented maze and reach Neon Tower is to rely on the ""Longings"" of Honami's Left Behind. Namipon produces a bottle filled with these lingering obsessions, explaining they can resonate with the Tower and guide you closer to the truth."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_1,"Ah, Ginga Street. A good place."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_2,Hello! Old friend!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_3,You know this place well.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_4,Mm. That's right. Those ad walls were once covered with my picture. And over there. Used to be claw and capsule machines... all the prizes were me.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_5,People really loved you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_6,Hehe... that's why I want to bring them back. I want to bring everyone home.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_7,"Leave the collecting to me. But, uh... once we start, the frequency spikes might draw in... things. I'll leave that part to you, okay?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_8,Just some old friends.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13001_9,Leave what?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13002_1,AHHHH! CHISA! PASSENGER! HELP! I CAN'T BE INTERRUPTED WHILE COLLECTING!!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13002_2,...I'm hearing strange sounds.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13002_3,You hear it too? Desperate voices... crying for help.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13003_1,Hmm. Looks like we haven't gathered enough. Maybe we need to find somewhere with more people?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13003_2,How about a bit farther ahead?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13003_3,Follow this road... Mm. This used to be Honami's main shopping street. Always full of life!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13003_4,"During the holidays, you'd see stalls on both sides. Shoppers everywhere. You could find all sorts of treasures… like me. In all kinds of shapes."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13004_1,Hm? Who's there?!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13004_2,Incoming!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13004_3,The Fractsidus... How did they get here?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13005_1,The voices are getting louder.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13005_2,"Echoes of the people's Longing. When too many gather at once, it's like someone hits a replay button in your head."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13006_1,It's uncomfortable. Heavy in the head. Tight in the chest. Like someone's squeezing you from the inside.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13006_2,But... hold on a little longer. It passes quickly.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13007_1,"That's direct... Well, efficiency first."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_13007_2,Might as well make use of it.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14_1,They left behind some kind of... device?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14_2,Looks like Frequency Detectors. But it's rough. Like something rushed the night before a lab demo. Even the most basic Frequency Stabilizers are missing.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14_3,Chisa! Passenger! Come quick! There's a lot of... strong Longings here!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14_4,Let's meet up with Namipon first.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14_5,"I'm not saying they're completely useless. Just that, performance-wise, it's not very reliable."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14001_3,That's it! I'm counting on you again!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14002_1,The number of Tacet Discords is increasing...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14002_2,Namipon said there are lots of Longings in this area.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14002_3,"There used to be a Commercial District here, one of the busiest parts of the city... It must've gathered the most lingering frequencies."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14002_4,"Mm, I also sense so many familiar scents of the past..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14003_1,These monsters... They're acting the same way as before.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14003_2,"When they become crystallized, they go berserk. Keep your guard up."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14003_3,But what's causing it in the first place?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14003_4,It's hard to say. Whatever it is... it hasn't fully shown itself yet.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14004_1,"But I have a guess, {PlayerName}."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14004_2,That thing... it's rejecting outsiders.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14004_3,"It's using the Tacet Discords as blades, driving them into a frenzy to stop anyone who doesn't belong to this city."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14005_1,"Wow, collecting in a crowded place really is different! We've got quite the catch. Let me sort them out..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14005_2,What's the matter?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14005_3,Did you hear that...?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14005_4,Help...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14005_5,"This is just my speculation, but something tells me a powerful, hidden force is behind these Tacet Discords, directing them to drive away all... outsiders."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14005_6,(Under what circumstances would you want to drive away outsiders...?)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14005_7,"(When you see this place as your own territory... your ""home."")"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_14005_8,"With the Tacet Discords cleared, Namipon excitedly checks the progress of your collected Longings. Chisa, folding away her scissor blades, shares a grim suspicion: a powerful, hidden force is commanding the Tacet Discords, driving them to expel any ""existence"" that does not belong to Honami City. As you consider this, a faint cry for help suddenly echoes nearby."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1401_1,This way! Over here!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1401_2,"You can start collecting now. Oh, and, um... More troublemakers might show up..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_15_1,It hurts...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_15_2,Help... Please help me...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_1,"He's wounded badly. Not good, already unconscious."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_2,"If we don't get him out, he won't make it."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_3,...Slicing has started.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_4,"Space fractures and is rearranged. Everything caught inside, people included... they're all twisted into absurd, broken shapes... until the Lament ends."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_5,Don't worry. I'll hold the line.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_6,"This time, we face it together."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_8,...Thank you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_9,The slicing is getting closer. Space will break down any moment now.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_10,Chisa?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_11,Is it... the Lament?!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_12,…
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_13,We need to get out of here immediately.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_14,Hold on to him. And hold onto me.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_16_15,"You help a wounded man to his feet, only to realize his condition is critical. As you guide him out, the Lament descends once more. Bizarre Irideglow ""slices"" through the visible space, creeping steadily closer. With seconds to spare, Chisa raises her scissor blades at the wall before you."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_161_11,Huh? You came back real quick this time...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_161_12,What just happened...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_161_13,That was my... Forte.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_161_14,"The sales champ rustles through its pouch, pulling out some meds. You lay the young man down on the sofa and tend to his wounds."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_161_53,"Wow, didn't expect to see you again so soon!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_161_54,"Hello, hello, hello! I'm your friendly mall guide, a goldstar salesbara! Thanks for waking me up! Thought I'd come here too..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_161_55,"Oh, is this young man injured? Hold on. I've got some meds!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_15,This one's the best fast-acting med I've got. Should start working soon.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_16,Are you alright?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_17,I'm fine.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_18,When we first met...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_19,"You cut open space, just like today."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_20,...I thought you'd be sent straight to this safe house. But my Forte was unstable. You ended up at the bus stop nearby.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_21,So I asked Namipon to find you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_22,"Mm, this Namipon is pretty dependable, huh?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_23,Thank you. Both of you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_24,"Hehe, no need to thank me. I'm just happy to meet you, Passenger."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_25,Ugh...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_27,How are you feeling?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_28,Oh... It's you! You two saved my life... Thank you...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_29,You're welcome. It's dangerous outside. You can sleep here tonight. We've got enough food for one more person.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_30,Thanks... I have to get home. My grandma's there alone. She must be worried sick.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_31,"No, I promised her yesterday... I said we'd watch TV together when I got back. I can't leave her waiting there alone—"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_32,No. Not yesterday. The day before...? I... I don't know.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_33,"No. No, no. I have to go home! Someone's waiting for me! I—"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_34,...No... Wait. Did I... already...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_35,No... I...I still haven't...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_56,Thank you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_57,A piece of cake!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_58,Oh! He's awake! He's awake!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_59,I just... need a little rest. I'm alright.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_60,Just focus on recovering first. You can leave once you're back on your feet.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_61,I remember the sky was gray when I left the supermarket. It was raining. Then... I haven't seen daylight since.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_62,"The TV had no sound. The phone wouldn't connect. The road outside the window was... I keep trying to go home, every day. But why..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_63,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1611_64,"Channeling her Forte, Chisa clips space to pull all of you safely back to Shashou Cafe. Just as it seems the immediate crisis has passed, the young Left Behind man you rescued vanishes before your eyes the moment he remembers the reason why he can never ""go home."""
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_42,Speaking of leads... do you know when the Fractsidus came to Honami?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_43,The Fractsidus? You mean the ones in red we ran into just now?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_44,"So that's their name... Sorry, I wasn't familiar with it. It was my first time in that zone. I've mostly explored the port area. Still no confirmed route to the Tower, but at least we've ruled out several dead ends."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_45,So there are other normal people in the city... I thought only the Red Cicadas in my hometown liked moving in swarms like that. Didn't expect to find another type like that here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_46,From what you said...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_47,The Fractsidus must've been in Honami for at least two months.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_48,And they've been running experiments here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_49,"I can't decipher their methods from their files, but something's clearly wrong."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_50,Our current priority is...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_51,Find out what clues are in their basket.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_52,"We could start from the Commercial District. That's where I first arrived when I was pulled into this Sonoro. If we're lucky, something's still there."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_55,Want to try this?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_56,This is...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_57,I scavenged it earlier. Some kind of fruit? Not sure if it suits your taste.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_58,"Ever since Honami fell under the Lament, food here became part of the Remnant Energy. Living things in this Sonoro no longer feel hunger... but to me, that's dangerous in itself."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_59,...I don't want to go numb.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_60,I don't want to get used to people disappearing into thin air. I don't want to get used to this loop. I have someone to find. Things to do... and a place to return to.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_61,"You feel the same, right?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_62,"Yeah, so we <i>will</i> leave here together."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_63,I <i>will</i> break this deadlock.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_64,"Our goals align. I don't care how impenetrable the Tower is, I'll cut a way right into it."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_65,"No matter how tight this cage is, I'll tear it down."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_66,"The more Longings we collect, the more leads we have. I trust that day will come."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_67,"Sure, but..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_68,"But tonight, we can take it easy."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_69,"No <te href=851066>Irideglow</te>. No Lament. Just Honami, a quiet city at night."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_70,Thanks for sharing this late-night snack with me... even if it's just canned fruit.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_71,"But still, thank you. See you tomorrow."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_72,Chisa.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_73,"Oh, good evening."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_74,"…Comparing them to the Red Cicadas might be rude. An invalid analogy too, forget it. Sorry."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_75,Space in Honami is already shattered glass. Anything too forceful could make the entire city collapse. These are hardly ideal conditions for experiments.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_76,I think... they must've discovered something.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_77,"Maybe a clue about the Tower. Or some secret of the Lament, hidden in this Sonoro. Something so important, they're willing to take the risk of their experimental site crumbling."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_78,We're not the only ones looking for a way out. They might already be ahead of us.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_1612_79,"That night, you and Chisa rest on a bench outside the cafe. She confides in you her refusal to grow numb and indifferent to the loop of life and death in the city. Together, you will find a way to tear this cage apart."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_1,Here we are.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_2,"I first ended up in this place two months ago. It wasn't during a Lament occurrence, so I had a bit of time to explore the city."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_3,Do you still remember what happened?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_4,Vaguely. But I do recall the first occurrence hit three days later.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_5,"At that time, Irideglow bled through the cracks in the gray sky, like the world had been sliced open by an invisible pair of scissors. People, buildings, even space itself… everything fell into chaos."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_7,Then we need to recreate the city as it was before the Lament to uncover what really happened…
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_8,Who's there?!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_9,"Ahem. Sharp as a tack, you two."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_10,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_11,"Since you've caught on, the game is afoot. Listen up, young folks! This district is full of secrets!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_12,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_13,"I've been staking out this area for three days, five hours, and... well, a long time! And guess what? I've spotted something really fishy!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_14,"Those red coats sneaking around and tinkering every day... Mark my words, they're up to no good!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_15,Red coats...? Could it be the Fractsidus?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_16,"So, what do you say? Care to join my Super Detective Team and hunt for the truth?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_17,Super detective team.. and hunt for the truth?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_18,Exactly! Just follow me. We're two clues away from cracking this wide open!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17_19,"The next day, you go to where Chisa first landed in Honami City two months ago. There, you have an unexpected encounter with the detective capybara, Polmes. It claims to have spotted suspicious activity and asks you to investigate."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17002_1,"Well, well, you seem quite familiar with this place, young lady."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17002_2,"Naturally. That's basic detective work... Wait, over there! That's it!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17002_3,So do you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17003_9,The Fractsidus must have left this device here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17003_10,But... it's inactive. Something's covering it.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17003_11,Irideglow Crystals. We need to clear them off first.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_12,"""Expand the existing Sonoro Sphere""... Could that really be their goal?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_13,It looks like they failed judging from this report.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_14,...This is absurd.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_15,"If the Sonoro could be controlled, then why... why hasn't this loop been broken? The Left Behind are still trapped in this false memory of peace."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_16,Controlling it can't be their objective. They're using it. Seeing if each Lament occurence is slower or the deaths more orderly... It's like throwing people into the fire just to test the temperature.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_17,By Jove! My instincts were right! They are up to something shady!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_19,These should be the Fractsidus's experimental devices.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_20,Is that a research report?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_21,(Pick up the research report)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_22,"Huh, first time seeing a report like this. ""Lament Residue""… could that be those iridescent things we just saw?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_23,"Hmm? Why so quiet, all of you?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_24,There might be more clues in other test sites.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_25,That's right! There's another one close by! This way!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17004_26,You uncover a Fractsidus research report shedding light on their actions in Honami City. It all points to the chilling goal of expanding this Sonoro Sphere and ultimately establishing control over it.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17005_1,"By the way, I didn't expect you to see through my disguise... Keen eyes like yours make you perfect candidates for my Super Detective Team!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17005_2,And what exactly does this team do?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17005_3,"Why, investigate those red-coated troublemakers, of course! But come to think of it, I haven't seen them around lately. Suspicious..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17005_4,May I ask how many members are on this team now?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17005_5,...Just the one capybara.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17005_6,"Ahem! Anyway, we've arrived!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17006_25,The plot thickens... this one's almost identical to the last report.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17006_26,Same sequence number... but different data.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17006_27,"So they've been running the same experiment repeatedly, with different results each time."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17006_28,But... why are they both labeled as No. 20?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17006_29,Another report. Just as we expected.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17006_30,(Pick up the research report)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17006_31,"Another report you find bears the exact same sequence number as the previous one, but its recorded data is different. This means the Fractsidus has been conducting the same experiment repeatedly, yet labeling every iteration as ""No. 20."""
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_1,"Good morning, Goshujin-sama! Did you have a good rest?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_2,Not bad.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_3,Still a bit tired...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_4,Your breakfast. Please enjoy.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_5,Thank you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_6,Were you... cleaning?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_7,"Yes, yes! It's such a nice day today, so Chisa went out scavenging for supplies. We wanted to do our part too... so we started tidying up!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_8,"Once we're done, maybe there'll be space for a few new decorations? Hmm... It might be a nice surprise for Chisa! Passenger, do you have any ideas?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_9,I'm not exactly an expert in interior design...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_10,I'll give it a try!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17007_11,"Wonderful! This way, if you please!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17008_1,Good morning. I'm back. Want something to eat? I picked up a few snacks from the store. Figured it'd be good to have some variety.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17008_2,Thank you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17008_3,"…Didn't expect the cafe to be this clean. For a moment, I thought I walked into the wrong place."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17008_4,"But it looks nice. Really lifts the mood. Thank you, all of you."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17008_5,"Well now, are you ready to go?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17008_6,Let's go.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_2,What's wrong?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_4,...Nothing. Just thinking about a friend.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_5,The one you mentioned before?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_8,"Yes. I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you her name. It's Sumika."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_9,"This is where I first met her, where our old base was. I left after the Lament sliced and stitched this place over and over… and I never returned."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_10,I want to go back. To see if there's anything we missed.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_11,I'll go with you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_12,Thank you. For accompanying me.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_13,Sure. We do need more leads.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_14,Ooo!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_15,"Zoning out, Detective?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_16,"Are you coming with us, Detective?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_17,I-I'm deep in deduction! Still need more clues to uncover what those red-coated rascals are really after.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_18,"Hmm, your invitation is appreciated, but a good detective never leaves a case unsolved. I still need more clues to uncover what those red-coated rascals are really after."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_19,I'll take my leave now. It's been a pleasure working with two sharp tools like you. Until next time!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_20,Well then...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_21,Let's go.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_22,"Back then, Sumika used to tease me. She'd say I had to map everything out—routes, terrain, vantage points, exits and entrances. All of it. But she… always went with her gut. Terrible sense of direction, though."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_23,"Even so, she chose to go to that tower alone."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_17009_24,"Chisa recalls that she and her friend Sumika once made a building here their old base. Believing the old hideout might still hold overlooked clues, you decide to investigate and part ways with Polmes for the time being."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18_1,A stash of old science magazines with notes scribbled on a few pages.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18_2,I found some too. Must've been Sumika's. She used to read here during her downtime.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18_3,What about you?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18_4,I'd be with her. Sometimes we'd read the same thing.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18_5,"But most of the time, I'd be maintaining my weapon."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18001_1,That stash in the corner... they're all clocks.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18001_2,"There used to be more. Sumika collected them, placing them all across the city before the Lament struck. Then she went back to retrieve them one by one. It was pure madness... but it proved her theory."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18001_3,"The closer you get to Neon Tower, the slower time moves. In other words, all of Honami City might be lagging behind the outside world."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18001_4,Remember that moss-covered watch? That's what first made Sumika notice something was off about this city.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_3,Sumika mentioned the strange flow of time here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_4,"The plants grow like everything's normal, yet those who died remain trapped in this loop. It's like something very powerful is holding them back."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_5,Look. More amber behind us. This piece looks like it was created recently.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_10,Is this a piece of amber?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_11,Sumika left it here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_12,Her Forte allows her to create amber that stores memories or moments in time.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_13,Memories or moments...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_14,Yes. Just hold it like this...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_15,…And you'll see what's been preserved inside.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_16,She told me that time within this Sonoro moves slower than it does outside.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_17,What's holding them back might just be their unfulfilled Longings.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_18,They awakened Namipon to a city that still needs him.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_19,Go on. Hold it like you did before.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_18002_20,"Inside the old base, you discover ambers formed from Sumika's Forte. As you and Chisa connect with them, you see moments Sumika chose to record."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_19_4,"Judging from her notes, she really did make it to Neon Tower."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_19_5,"We need to find a way there. The sooner, the better."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_19_6,Let's return to the cafe first. We'll need to check with Namipon and see if the Longings we've gathered are enough to guide us to the Tower.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_1,"Inside the Error Cell, Shorekeeper isolates a hidden message embedded in the abnormal frequency from the chaotic data streams—a set of shifting spatial coordinates."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_3,You have come.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_4,How's it going?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_5,Any luck tracking the frequency?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_6,"This marks the Tethys System's first large-scale expansion of its frequency feature library. We needed to deploy it while it's still under validation. The data stream is immense, and I need more time. However..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_7,"...Within the chaos, I found a fragmented message."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_8,A fragmented message?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_9,"Yes. The source identity is unclear, but we have isolated a set of constantly shifting spatial coordinates."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_10,"One points to an unknown location. The other... points here, to the Black Shores."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_11,Whoever left that message knew exactly where to find the Black Shores. And if they do…
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_12,I'll check it out.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2_13,"Understood. I will send the coordinates to your Terminal. I must remain here to continue isolating and tracing embedded messages in the surrounding frequencies. I entrust this to you, my star."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_1,"Actually… after reading Sumika's notes, I noticed something we might have missed."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_2,What is it?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_3,"The Lament we're experiencing here in Honami... it doesn't feel like the real thing. It's weaker, like the power is fading..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_4,"Welcome back, dear Passengers!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_5,"If we want real answers, we'll need to reach the Lament's source... inside Neon Tower."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_6,Would you like a cup of Coconut Cheese Latte made by yours truly? It's called Cloudy Coconut Sea.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_7,"At the very least, we can now confirm this is tied to the Fractsidus's Controllable Sonoro Project."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_8,Hello? Heelllloooo?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_9,…Ah. Sorry. Didn't mean to ignore you. We got a little distracted.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_10,It's okay. I'm used to it.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_11,"By the way, Passenger... there's something I need to tell you."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_12,"I sensed a frequency that's closely connected to you. It's not from this space, but... it's calling for you."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_13,Connected to me?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_20_14,Not in this space?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_15,"Correct. It's beyond Honami City. Mm, part of it resonates from within you, but… it's not your frequency. What could it be?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_16,Within me...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_17,Abby?!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_18,Who's Abby?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_19,An Echo companion.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_20,My friend.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_21,I see... I haven't seen it before.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_22,Abby is being blocked by this Sonoro.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_23,"Maybe it's looking for you, just like Namipon said."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_24,"Hmm... If you're in a hurry to meet it, I can try recalibrating Neon Tower's coordinates. But it'll take a little more time. Please wait patiently."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_25,"You seem concerned about this Abby, Passenger."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_26,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_27,Because Abby is important to me.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_28,"Mhm, I can feel it too. Don't worry. I'll do my best."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_29,"So please, get some rest... for those who care about you."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_30,Do you... want to take a breather on the terrace?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_31,Sure.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_32,"Don't worry, Passenger. I'll do my best."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_33,Maybe later.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_34,Okay. Whenever you're available.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_35,Is it... coming from the outside? Is the connection between this Sonoro and the outside world growing stronger?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_36,But this space should be completely sealed off... unless the restraints around this Sonoro are weakening. Could it be... because of the Longings we gathered?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2001_37,"Back at the cafe, Namipon senses a frequency calling out for you. It's not of this space, but emanating from within you. You realize it must be Abby. Could this mean the restraints around this Sonoro Sphere are beginning to weaken?

Determined, Namipon begins sifting through the collected Longings to chart a route toward Neon Tower. While you wait for the results, Chisa invites you to join her for a breather on the cafe's terrace."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_1,"After leaving the Error Cell, you encounter Buling, who has also sensed the abnormal frequency. Using her Forte, she helps pinpoint the exact location of the shifting coordinates."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_2,"This is bad, really bad! Just look at my Casket of Fate! It's been rattling nonstop all day! All day! I haven't seen it this jumpy in years!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_3,Didn't expect to run into you here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_4,"I know, right? Thought I'd come back to do some quick biz... You know, fix up the feng shui, zing up some romance luck for the lonely hearts... But wah, this one is a big, big problem."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_5,"The voices won't stop pouring in. Feels like a whole swarm of abnormal frequencies gathering up. And look! My Pendant of Shifting Yao's so hot, I could fry an egg on it!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_6,You've sensed that abnormal frequency too?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_7,"Delicate threads, twisted webs. A deadlock. It's trapped in a formation... It shouldn't even exist in this world."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_8,"Got any leads, Boss? Maybe I can help crack this one too."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_9,Actually... I've got a pair of shifting spatial coordinates.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_10,Oh really? Show me! I can try to track them down.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_18,"Ms. Buling, we understand your concern. But the Tethys System hasn't completed its analysis yet, and your talisman divination isn't always—Ahem, what I mean is, without proper clearance, we can't initiate a high-level response..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_19,"You trust those wires over me? I dreamed last night of three upside-down houses right outside my window. That's a horrible omen! And I felt Yin energy. That means something living is behind it. It's not an ordinary frequency, okay?!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_20,"It's not that we don't trust you, Ms. Buling. It's just... last time, when you dreamed of a black cat dancing ritualistically, it turned out your Casket just had water in it."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_21,We'll begin parallel observation once Tethys completes its full spectrum diagnostics. It's for everyone's safety here in the Black Shores...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_201_22,"Aiya... by the time you're done crunching the data, even the immortals will be too old to—Oh! Boss! Didn't see you there!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_1,"Nice weather today. Rare to see a sunset like this. If Sumika were here, she'd probably capture this moment in one of her ambers."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_2,Because it's beautiful?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_3,Looking at it does take a weight off.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_5,See that child by the signpost?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_6,That's the seventh time I've seen him fall there.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_7,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_8,"The cashier keeps wiping a stain that isn't there... The walls are barely standing, but her uniform is spotless... just like it was."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_9,The vending machine is due for restocking. With soda bottles that are already decades old.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_10,That cat has been lying there for two months... maybe longer. I've only known it for two.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_11,"Middle school students are still taking photos of the sky after class, one that is now torn apart by Resonance Cords. But in their eyes, it's still clouds. Birds. Rainbows... the perfect sky of that single day."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_12,The store keeps playing pop songs from the last century. The window that never shut all the way is still stuck at the notch it was left on years ago.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_13,They've all been left behind in the past.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_14,As for me... I'm starting to forget what day it is today.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_15,This kind of life almost feels like...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_16,An anime episode that got cut halfway?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_17,A unsaved file?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_18,Feels like what?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_19,"…Heh. Interesting analogy. When I was little, every summer break was spent with cool fans, watermelons, and an old TV. I loved watching anime and was always curious about those... special worlds."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_20,"…Heh. Interesting analogy. When I was little, I once lost an entire holiday's worth of homework I'd worked really hard on. My parents and teachers didn't scold me, but I still felt terrible about it for a long time... Now I always save my work the second I finish it."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_21,I think it's kind of like... an unanswered call.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_22,"My parents were always busy. Whenever I missed them, I'd try calling... but most of the time, they couldn't answer. Even when they did, we never had much to say."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_24,Do you miss them?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_25,I can't say we're very close.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_26,"...It's not that I hate them. Things were just... ordinary. They had their jobs, I had school. We hardly spent time together."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_27,"But... sometimes, I do miss them. Just a little."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_28,That's why you have to leave here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_29,You need to get back to keep living your life.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_30,I really... really want to end this vicious loop.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_31,"I've already tried so many times, but the outcome is always the same..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_32,But you still haven't stopped trying.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_33,"Every time the Lament struck, you moved toward Neon Tower, against the tide of fleeing citizens, knowing full well it was the most dangerous place to be."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_34,"You knew you couldn't save those who were already ""gone,"" and still, you reached out. To the mother and daughter. To the injured young man. To me, when I first fell into this city."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_35,"You knew that in this endless loop, saving someone didn't change a thing. But still, not once did you ignore a cry for help. So..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_39,Which means there's a chance to break it completely. I'm willing to put my faith in you. Let's seize that chance together.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_40,Why would you...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_41,Because we're partners. Isn't it only natural for me to trust you?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_42,Chisa—! Passenger—!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_43,I-I just confirmed Neon Tower's coordinates!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_44,"In my hometown, Resonators aren't really accepted. Someone who can't control their abilities is like a ticking time bomb... feared and resented."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_45,"I didn't want my parents to suffer because of me. So I thought... maybe if I stayed away, they wouldn't have to deal with the looks. Or the whispers."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_46,"After I became a Resonator and was placed under supervision, those chances became even rarer. I think the things people said about me ended up putting a lot of pressure on them, too."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_47,No. To investigate what could possibly cause a sunset so unusual...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_48,So you appeared.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_49,At a time no one should have. In the most dangerous place. Beneath the Lament's shadow. It wasn't luck or coincidence.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_50,"The Sonoro isn't fully sealed anymore. Sumika cracked it open. And from the moment we met, the loop had already begun to loosen."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_21_51,"You follow Chisa up to the cafe's terrace. The setting sun bathes the ruined city in a warm glow. You both lean against the railing, watching the Irideglow slice and stitch the cityscape in an endless cycle. In this quiet moment, Chisa opens up about her past for the first time."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_22_1,"Whew… The way to Neon Tower is in disarray, but lucky us! We've got this!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_22_2,Press this... and that should do it!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_22_3,"Now we have a route to the Tower's base. Once you're all set, we can move out!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2201_1,"To the Tower we go! Are you ready, Passenger?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2201_2,Ready as ever.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2201_3,I need time to prepare.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2202_1,"Over here! Over here! Yup, right there!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2202_2,"The big tall Tower, hiding in the broken city... it's finally opened up for us! Let's gooo!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23_1,(Coughing)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23_2,(Coughing) So much dust!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23_3,"So much rubble from the city scattered in here... debris and loose junk. Watch your step, everyone."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23_4,We need to bypass all this and find a way to get to the top...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23_5,"If Sumika really made it this far, she would have left a sign for me to follow."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23001_7,Sumika might have taken this path straight ahead.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23001_8,Let's go check it out.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23001_19,Look! A shiny stone!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23001_20,...It's Sumika's amber.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23002_1,"Whoa, this is..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23002_2,The Fractsidus referred to these as Light Irideglow Crystals in their reports. Might be Lament residue.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23002_3,"Just like before, we should be able to clear them out to restore the area."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23003_15,Sumika said her body was getting colder...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23003_16,It is unusually cold here. There's a strange sensation of warmth being pulled away.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23003_17,Yup... my bones are starting to shake!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23003_18,"Whatever is causing it, we need to stay sharp."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23004_1,More Irideglow Crystals here!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23004_2,Let's clear them off. Sumika's notes might have been buried beneath.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23005_10,She said the path ahead is wrong...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23005_11,We need to go back!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23005_12,"Hey, wait... w-wait for me... I'm freezing out here... Brrr..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23005_15,This is it... Sumika's amber.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23005_16,(Pick up the amber and hold it in your palm)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23006_13,Look at those chairs.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23006_14,They're covered in Irideglow Crystals too… Sumika's notes must be hidden underneath.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_23006_15,Whoa... look how big! And that tree!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_1,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_2,Sumika... She marked every correct path. That's an amazing deed.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_4,What's... that sound? Am I just... hearing things?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_5,Are those... people from the Black Shores?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_6,"Hey! You... Can you see this ""entrance""?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_7,Please... help the people here... They're trapped...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_8,My friend... she's trapped here...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_9,Please...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_10,Just once...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_11,Let me win.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_12,Ahh... what an incredible girl.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_13,"She got so close to finding the source of the Lament in the city. But as long as someone keeps going where she left off, she wouldn't have regretted it. Not once did she live with regret."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_14,Did you hear that?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_15,Argh... Sounds like the space inside the tower is being sliced up.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_16,How did we miss it? Is it because the Lament here is different from the one outside?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_17,"Or maybe, the Tower itself has already been consumed by the Lament and has become a part of it."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_18,"{PlayerName}, Namipon. Take my hand."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_19,"A-aachoo! O-okay, Chisa!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_20,Huh?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_21,Aaaaahhhhh—
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_24_22,"From Sumika's amber, you witness her final moments. Barely clinging to life, Sumika reaches a trembling hand toward a rift torn open by the Lament. Her last hope is that someone will find this city, break the tragic loop, and free her friend."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_29_2,You...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_29_3,GET… OUT—!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_29_4,"Take your cursed, bloated luxury of time—!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_29_5,Don't touch our cocoon... Woven for ██ years…
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_29_6,Buried here… is our home…
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_29_7,GET OUT—
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_29_8,GET OUUUUUT——!!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_2901_1,One hour ago.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_30_1,(This is...)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_30_2,(Another space sliced apart by the Lament?)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_30_3,(They're... not here?)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3002_1,"A mirage from nowhere, a shadow of ruins... Just looking at it sends a chill through me."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3002_2,"{PlayerName}, there's something I want to tell you. But... maybe I'm just imagining things."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3002_3,What did you find?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3002_4,That city... looks just like my hometown. The one swallowed by the Lament. I sensed a familiar frequency from it...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3002_5,"I've been away a long time. My memory could be wrong. But when facing the unknown, even the smallest thread might lead somewhere."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3002_6,Maybe it once... really existed.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3003_13,What is that?!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3003_14,A city... submerged underwater?!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3003_15,But... it looks like it's been completely destroyed...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3003_16,"The world's flipped. Rivers run backward. The sun and moon fall out of sync. The jade Buddha lowers his gaze—Boss, that is not a good sign."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3003_17,That is...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3003_18,"After Buling pinpoints the location, a strange mirage of a city suddenly materializes over the waters near the Black Shores Archipelago."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3010_4,"Oh, is she the transfer student?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3010_5,Probably. Heard she's a supervised Resonator... Better keep our distance...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3010_6,That explains it... Look at that thing on her neck...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3011_7,Why is she wearing that? Creepy... is it because she hurt someone?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3011_8,Definitely. Just look at her... she's terrifying...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3012_9,"What are you doing, Kuchiba Chisa! Just introduce yourself!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3012_10,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_31_1,This is... <ano=Train Conductor>Shashou</ano> Cafe.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_31_2,Chisa!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_31_3,You...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_32_1,Chisa! Chisa! Thank you so much!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_32_2,Thank... me? For what?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_32_3,"Heh, you forgot already? For helping me with my homework, of course! You're a genius! No one else in the class could've solved that tough equation but you!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_32_4,"I was so wrong about you before! Please don't be mad at me, okay? Can we still be friends, Chisa?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_32_5,I...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_32_6,"Hehe, I just knew you'd forgive me! You're always so kind, Chisa. So sweet, so bright... Honestly, you're like, the bestest ever!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3201_1,(Yes. All of you are... my friends.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3202_1,"Chisa, you're here! Thank you for saving us!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3202_2,"Saving you...? That isn't right, I-I didn't..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3202_3,"Chisa, stop being so modest! We wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. We all owe you so much. You're our savior!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3202_4,"We're all here enjoying life in the cafe because of you, Chisa. We can't imagine this place without you!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3202_5,R-Really? Did I… actually help you all?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3202_6,Of course! Don't you remember? Look over there—see those teachers and students? We're all here because of you...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3203_1,"Look at everyone's smiles. It's all because of you. Without you, this place would be cold and empty again, right?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3203_2,"Come to see everyone, Chisa. We all like you so much..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3203_3,"Everyone needs you... Please, we want you to stay with us..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3203_4,"A life like this feels great, doesn't it? To be loved, to be needed... Could you really give that up?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3203_5,"Why won't you come over, Chisa?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3203_6,"Why won't you come over, Chisa?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_33_1,No... don't go...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_33_2,Stop...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_33_3,Don't go...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_33_4,DON'T GO!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3302_1,No... don't go...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3302_2,Stop...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3302_3,Don't go...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3302_4,CHISA! COME BACK!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3303_1,No... don't go...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3303_2,Stop...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3303_3,Don't go...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3303_4,TURN AROUND AND HOLD MY HAND!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3333_1,I've never seen anything like it. But that city... it's nothing but ruins now.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3333_2,"{PlayerName}, do you think it's a projection of the past or the future?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_34_1,"Are you alright, Chisa? Do you feel better now?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_34_2,"If you start feeling Overclocking symptoms, you should tell me."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3401_1,"Don't worry. I've installed an Overclocking detector in your collar. If anything goes wrong, we'll know immediately."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3401_2,There's nothing to be afraid of...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3401_3,Just enjoy every moment of your student life here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3402_1,"We've always seen you as someone we can really count on. You should believe in yourself more, too."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3402_2,"Since we ended up here together, that makes us partners... even friends!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_3402_3,Didn't we promise to chase the stars? To go where the torch of truth burns bright—
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_1,"This power was always yours. We only gave you the choice—to step into the stars, to seek the truth, and to protect the ones around you."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_2,"Welcome to Startorch Academy, Miss Kuchiba Chisa."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_3,"There you are! Heh, so this is where you've been hiding from us these last few days!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_4,"Don't shut us out, Chisa. We know you Overclocked, but that doesn't change anything. You'd never hurt us, we know that!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_5,Yeah! We were super worried when you ran off like that.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_6,There has to be a way to treat your condition. Maybe we can ask the instructors at the Academy?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_7,I'll go with you!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_8,How does it feel now? Any discomfort?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_9,"You see, Chisa, you can take it off whenever you want. It won't bind you anymore. And it never should have."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_10,"You're a bright, remarkable child. I believe you'll reach the farthest stars together with your companions."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_11,Why would you... trust me?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_12,Because we're partners.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_13,Isn't it only natural for me to trust you?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_14,You're Chisa. Of course you can do this!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_15,There's nothing you can't overcome.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_16,"You carry a strength deeper than anyone's, Chisa. Even if you fall ten thousand times, you'll still find the courage to rise again. You just haven't realized it yet."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_17,"We're gonna go so far together, just wait and see!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_18,"Don't give up, Chisa. We're all looking forward to the future you'll create."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_35_19,"Chisa gazes into the distance, memories of her time in Lahai-Roi surfacing before her eyes—the kind professors, the idealistic students, and the future they all vowed to fight for: a world free of the Lament. The light of Startorch has always burned eternally in her heart."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_36_1,Chisa! Long time no see.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_36_2,I'm going to... Take care of yourself while I'm gone.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_36_3,"If you ever find yourself in trouble, look for this person."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_36_5,But even without a guide… I trust you'll still find your own tomorrow.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_36_6,So... go run to it.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_36_10,Nothing can trap you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_36_12,Nothing can trap me... I'll find my way back.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_36_13,Even if I have to shatter myself a thousand times!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_37_1,Hey! Chisa! Passenger! You're finally here! I-I've been stuck here for ages!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_37_2,It's seriously dangerous here! That thing… it's right over there!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_37_3,Are you alright?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_37_4,I'm okay. Just got turned around when the space split.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_37_5,Well then...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_37_6,It's time to send it back.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_1,I'm finally back!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_2,Welcome back!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_3,"Mommy, what's that?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_4,Time to clock out. I need a proper rest.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_5,Look at this! I managed to buy the newest bread special!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_6,"Argh, I'll miss the last bus..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_9,I'm home!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_10,"...Just glad you're back, Chisa."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_14,"Mmm, what a lovely ending."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_15,"Lantern lights glow warm, curtains sway in tea's sigh... And the boat comes home..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_16,"Dear Passengers, this... is as far as I go. We'll..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_18,This is... the end of this story.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_19,An ending that gently mirrors its beginning.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_20,Come on over and try your father's new dish!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_21,"Coming! You know what, Mom? I tripped today..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_22,...Just glad you're back.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_23,Go home now.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_24,"By the way, about that anomaly... I made a new discovery!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_26,Buildings closer to the tower in the central district...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_28,Hmm... The way the second hand moves...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_31,Ta-da! Superstar Namipon's here!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_32,Your coffee's here! It's still hot and steaming...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_33,"Wherever you go, whenever it is, you'll always have a place with us."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_38_34,Stay safe. Stay happy.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_1,Why are you out here alone?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_2,...Hm.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_3,It's just… I still can't quite accept it.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_4,"I know they died a long time ago, and they were only Human Reverberations that the Sonoro created. But now they're all... gone."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_5,You need time to accept that they're gone.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_6,You need time to accept what's changed.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_7,"And Namipon... even though we were only together for two months, every time I came back to the cafe... it was always there, waiting for me."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_8,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_9,"No choice, I have to face it... Let's go."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_39_10,"Thanks to your efforts, the Left Behind have finally found their way ""home."" But with the mission ended and Namipon vanishing, a piercing loneliness overwhelms Chisa. You find her sitting alone on a bench in the park outside the cafe."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_1,"A mysterious spatial rift appears, leading to an unknown Sonoro Sphere. Researchers from the Black Shores quickly assemble a makeshift observation platform nearby. You want to enter the rift, but Buling can't shake a sense of dread."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_2,"Great, {PlayerName}, you're here!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_3,Here I am.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_4,How's everything going?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_5,Good. Let me give you a quick briefing on what we've learned so far. This spatial rift leads to an unknown Sonoro Sphere.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_6,"Some Bloom Bearers attempted to enter for investigation, but... the rift appears to resist all forms of entry and interference."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_7,"As far as we know, this spatial rift leads to an unknown Sonoro Sphere. Some Bloom Bearers attempted to enter for investigation, but... the rift appears to resist all forms of entry and interference."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_8,The mirage we're seeing is a projection leaking from the Sonoro into reality.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_9,(The researcher from earlier said it might have been a real city...)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_10,"(But if that's true, why is it being projected into the rift? And why were its coordinates sent to the Black Shores?)"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_11,"Hey, Boss! You zoned out again. Still thinking about the creepy rift, huh?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_12,...Something about this isn't normal.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_13,"The frequency data sent to the Black Shores, the coordinates pointing to this rift, this Sonoro of a ruined city... It's hard to make sense of the info we have. If only we could enter it ourselves..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_14,"Would've been nice, huh? But this thing's got its doors shut tight to outsiders. But you {PlayerName}, you might be different! You're always full of surprises."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_15,"Still, are you sure you want to? I've ""seen"" it... That's a Death Gate, clear as day."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4_16,(Maybe I should try using the power of separation? I might be able to split the projection from the rift...)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_1,"Sunlight through the glass, sugar cubes crackle in sun, the scent of tea drifts—Hey! No snatching, no snatching!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_2,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_3,...What... How are you—?!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_4,Hm? I'm brewing tea for you.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_5,"But you said... ""this is as far as I go""?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_6,Uh... yes. It was as far as I could go because I had to go back to the cafe first...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_7,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_8,It just… took a bit longer to finish that sentence.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_9,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_10,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_11,Wh-what's wrong?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_12,Nothing... forget it.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_13,I'm just... glad you're back.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_14,What's your plan next?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_15,There's something I need to finish. But...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_16,"But before that, you need to handle something personal?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_17,Now can you finally tell me?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_18,...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_19,"Always so reserved, Chisa. I'll say it for you, then—"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_20,My Overclocking symptoms are—
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_21,"My Overclocking symptoms... they're not fully resolved. Inside this Sonoro, things are stable. But once I leave... I don't know if it'll spiral out of control."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_22,"Still... even if I do Overclock, I wouldn't just attack someone. Sumika once mentioned she had some friends, researchers, who might be able to treat me. But... but I..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_23,I happen to know her friends.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_24,Do want to try trusting me now?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_25,...Huh?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_26,Come to the Black Shores with me.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_27,To the place where Sumika once lived and worked. To where a new beginning awaits.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_29,What I said earlier… wasn't quite right. This is the real ending.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_30,Mm. So wholesome.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_32,"Ah, Passengers! You're back!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_33,Now… it's time to take that step toward a new beginning.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_34,Wait... that's...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_40_35,"You return to the cafe to find Namipon in a lively tussle with its companions over a plate of snacks—it hadn't disappeared after all!

With one story concluded, a new journey awaits. At your invitation, Chisa agrees to travel with you back to the Black Shores, to see the place where Sumika once lived and worked… and to step into a new beginning."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4001_1,Hm? I smell something special...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_4001_2,"You consider trying to split the mirage from the rift, but before you can act, a hand bursts from the rift and pulls you in. With Buling and Abby's cries fading behind you, you're dragged into the unknown Sonoro Sphere's turbulent depths."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_1,This place... it's where I first arrived in Honami.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_2,"Back then, Neon Tower was engulfed by the Lament. But now that the warped space has settled… even the wind feels calmer."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_3,At last… we've reached the end.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_4,...Or maybe... this is where it all begins.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_5,...Abby?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_6,"Wahh! Wh-why didn't you answer me?! I waited outside forever! I had to force my way in to find you! Seriously, I thought you were—"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_7,This Sonoro was sealed off from the outside world. But it looks like it's reopened now.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_8,"Yup! All thanks to our pals at the Black Shores! They've been working nonstop to install all kinds of devices. And with the connection getting stronger, I finally managed to slip through when the rift popped back up and... Wait..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_9,Hello.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_10,A new face! Hiya! Is she coming with us?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_11,Of course. We're just about to leave.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_12,Someone's still waiting for us.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_41_13,"You and Chisa return to the city center, the very place where you first arrived in Honami City. The clouds above Neon Tower have parted, and sunlight bathes the city in a newborn radiance. Abby descends from the sky, landing safely in your arms.

In that moment, you both realize the Sonoro's restraining seal has been broken. Together, you have opened a way for Honami City to connect with the world outside."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_1,"Hello again, Passenger!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_2,How's the cafe now?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_3,How's Honami City now?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_4,How are you doing now?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_5,All good here! We've got everything covered. Don't worry about a thing.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_6,"Whenever you've got a moment, just drop by. I'll have a fresh cup of coffee waiting for you. And I'll even share my favorite Rice Dango with you..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_7,"Oh, and if you can… bring Chisa too. I miss her. She used to carry me through the streets of Honami. Our walks were always so much fun..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_8,"Passenger, the time we spent together… no matter how many times I think back on it, it always feels special. The kind of memory you want to hug close under your pillow forever."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_9,"Still not totally normal. There's some Lament energy hanging around. But thanks to all of you, the people's leftover Longings all drifted up into the sky that night."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_10,"Like tiny stars tucked into colorful bubbles, they blew away with the wind, carried to the edge of the sky where the light is."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_11,"I think they made it to a better place… Back to the ones they loved most. No regrets left behind. Because every story deserves a gentle, wholesome ending."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_12,"I'm good. Really good, mhmm! Just the other day, I made a Rice Dango all by myself! The shape was… well, not good. But it was sweet and yummy!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_13,"Chisa used to make them for me, but now I can do it too. You should try one next time!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_14,"Do you want to explore the outside world with me, Namipon?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_15,"Aw, an invitation like that really makes me happy... But I can't leave this city."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_16,"I was born because of Honami, and I'll stay here to the very end. This is my home. Even if it means reliving the same loop forever... I'd still be happy."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_42_17,"You can come back anytime, Passenger. I'll keep the coffee warm and the Rice Dangos soft. This place will always welcome your arrival."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_43_1,"Welcome back, {PlayerName}. Are you here to check on Chisa?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_43_2,How's she doing now?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_43_3,I was just passing through.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_43_4,Chisa's been moved to a sealed treatment chamber. She's under close observation and receiving phased therapeutic support.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_43_5,"Her body's been running under Overclocked strain for quite some time; some of her vitals aren't in great shape. Simply put… she's holding on, but her body is clearly exhausted."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_43_6,"That said, we've started identifying some promising treatment paths. Early response looks good. We're not going to get back to full strength overnight, but with a little time, she should recover steadily. Nothing critical at this point."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_43_7,"Then I'll get back to analyzing her readings! Overall, things are moving in the right direction. Just give us a bit more time, and she'll be alright."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_1,My name is Kuchiba Chisa...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_2,My homeland
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_3,...Much like myself.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_4,"Dear Passengers, a minor Tacet Field detected has caused the train to be delayed by approximately 30 minutes."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_5,Don't tell me it's those Resonators again.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_6,"Ugh, give me a break. I'll be late for work..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_7,"When their Tacet Marks take over, they turn into Tacet Fields..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_8,Can't they just ban those freaks from public transport already?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_9,Keep your voice down. Look...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_10,Again... these voices...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_11,You Awakened... to protect a classmate who was being bullied?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_12,Don't be afraid.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_13,Who... who did this?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_14,So what?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_15,"Stop it, don't provoke her..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_16,I guess some people don't care about putting others in jeopardy.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_17,Let's just move to another carriage.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_18,I don't want to sit near a monster...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_19,In conclusion... strict oversight of Resonators is essential to ensuring societal stability...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_20,Hey... did you hear?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_21,You mean that Kuchiba girl?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_22,I feel bad for her parents.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_23,Clients have been canceling orders lately…
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_24,Are you blaming this on our daughter?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_25,"No, I didn't mean it like that."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_26,"I'm sorry, Chisa..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_27,Enough...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_28,I've had enough.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_29,"is a solitary island, walled in on all sides..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_30,What a good girl.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_31,This device can help you return to a normal life.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_32,I knew there was something off about her.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_33,She's taking the train in that state?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_34,"Who would've thought, right? Tch..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_35,Because of Chisa...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_44_36,Mom and Dad should've done better...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_5_1,Alert! Alert! Emergency situation confirmed. Current threat level has exceeded critical threshold!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_5_2,"Attention all civilians. Estimated safe evacuation time remaining: 1 minute, 41 seconds..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_5_3,"Look for the evacuation route indicated by the ████ light. Personnel carrying weapons or supplies, proceed through the ████ passage..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_5_4,Repeat: Initiate emergency evacuation immediately... Repeat: Initiate emergency evacuation immediately...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_1,"You jolt awake at a bus station within a devastated city, the tower you just saw still looming in the distance. People linger around you, sitting or standing as they wait, some even clutching at seemingly invisible objects. They act as if the catastrophe they just experienced never even happened. You try your Terminal to call for help, but the connection is dead. You call out to Abby, but your Tacet Mark remains unresponsive."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_2,Urgh...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_3,Abby? ...Abby?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_5,(The comms are cut... and Abby isn't answering.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_8,(...No. That's not right.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_9,(Something strange is definitely going on here.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_11,(That girl... She's not here either. And the hand that pulled me in... It wasn't hers. That one had a wristwatch.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_12,(These people... Why are they tinted with such strange colors?)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_13,"(Judging by the tower's position, I didn't land where I came in. Was it that girl's doing? Or just the nature of this Sonoro?)"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7_14,"(The chaos just moments ago... and now, everything's back to normal. What changed so fast?)"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7001_1,"Ugh, this new dish is too spicy..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7001_2,Shouldn't have fallen for the limited edition hype...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7002_1,Why's the school bus so late today...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7002_2,I'm going to be late...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7003_1,Finally... the holiday is almost here.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7004_1,"Well, I'm planning to resign next month..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7004_2,Huh? At least wait until you get your bonus!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7004_3,"Yeah, I know, I know..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7004_4,But look at the weather. It's so nice. Days like this just make me want to quit and spend more time with my family.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7005_1,I checked around. The fruit's cheapest over on Commercial Street.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7005_2,"Oh, and I heard there's another sale today!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7005_3,Fantastic! I'll pick up some fresh ones for the kids later...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7006_1,"Yo, you hear? We're up against Class C in next week's basketball game!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7006_2,Class C?! No way we're winning that...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7006_3,Man… My dad promised a family trip if we won…
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_1,"Yes, hello? What's the matter? Did you come to the wrong bus stop?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_2,What is this place?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_3,Where are you going?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_4,What is this place? This is downtown Honami.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_5,"...Ah, I see. You must be a traveler! This is a nice season for sightseeing, after all... Shame I can't take any time off. It's even my daughter's birthday today..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_6,"Where...? To the office, of course..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_7,"Just thinking about work makes me feel sick. But today's my daughter's birthday, so I've got to finish early. No overtime."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_8,What day is it today?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_9,"Today... I just said, it's my daughter's birthday. I need to clock out early and get the cake and...?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7007_10,Isn't it... Isn't it her birthday today...? Then why am I not home...?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7008_1,Hi! Hello! Do you need any help?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7008_2,Do you remember what just happened?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7008_3,What happened here?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7008_4,Huh? What just happened...?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7008_5,"What happened here? Oh, you mean in Honami?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7008_6,"Well, you know, everything's really nice here! Honami is so big and busy, a lot livelier than the little town I'm from!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7008_7,What do you mean? We've only just met.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_1,"Oh, hi! Do you need something?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_2,Do you think there's something odd going on around here?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_3,Could you tell me more about this city?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_4,O-odd? I'm not sure what you mean… Everything seems normal to me.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_5,(Tell her what you saw.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_6,Huh? Maybe you were... sleepwalking? Everything's fine here. I'm on my way to school... Please don't go saying weird stuff like that!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_7,"Oh, I see. You're not from around here, are you? This is Honami! It's really nice!"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_8,"Just across the street is the Sakura Pedway. People like to walk their dogs there, or take pictures. And if you turn right up ahead, that's the entrance to Hanakage Underground Street. A great spot to pick up souvenirs."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_9,"Oh, and I heard there's a new exhibition today. I was thinking... maybe I could buy some flowers for my mom after school. We... had a fight a few days ago. I still haven't found the right moment to say sorry..."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_10,"Do you think… if I give her flowers, she'll know it's an apology?"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_11,She'll definitely know that it is.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_12,"She's probably waiting to talk to you, too."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_13,"You really think so? Thanks! When I get home, I'll—"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7009_14,Wait... Am I... fading? But why? I just want to go home...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7010_1,How many times do I have to say it? It's not my fault! I already finished my part! So why the hell is it all on me? Hello? Hey!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7010_2,...Tch. <i>Kuso</i>!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7010_3,Excuse me...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7010_4,What's the point anymore...? It's all so damn pointless. Getting paid like a part-timer while doing a full-time load... Getting treated like dirt but still sucking up to bosses and customers. For what? Is this what living is?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7010_5,I came all the way to Honami ten years ago. I was young. Hungry. Full of dreams. Thought I'd build a life here. And now what? So the thirty-year-old me could wake up to this?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7010_6,My life… My time... Does any of it mean anything?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_7011_10,(I should look around first.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8_1,"Hello, Passenger. Please keep going straight ahead."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8_2,Who's talking?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8_3,"Cross the footbridge, and you'll find some nice supplies waiting just for you. Look out for the red vending machine... Oh, and watch your step when you see a coffee cup tile on the ground."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8_4,"When you spot an adorable statue and a wooden sign with coffee beans on it, that means you've arrived."
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8_5,The coffeehouse opens when the subway does. Our Namipon team will be there to take your order. Just look for cute uniforms.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8_6,…Guess I'll follow these instructions for now.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8_7,I'll trust my own judgment.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8001_1,(This place... isn't right.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8001_2,"(The people act like everything's normal, but the city itself... It's long been abandoned.)"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8001_3,(Why can't they see how strange this all is?)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8002_1,(An abandoned city... Could there really be this many people going about their lives?)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8004_1,"(These people are clearly not in their right minds. No point pressing for answers, I'll only get fragments. Best to see for myself. Maybe I can connect the dots.)"
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8004_2,(Is that... a box? Must be the supplies mentioned before.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8005_1,Over here! Over here!
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8005_2,Coming! Wait for me...
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8005_3,(Are they... both heading to that place?)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8006_1,(What's that sound?)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_8006_2,(I'll go check it out.)
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_9001_1,What is that?
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_9001_2,These Tacet Discords... Something's wrong with them!
Main_Honami_2_8_2_1_1,(Chisa's been in the Black Shores' care after Honami. I wonder how she's doing.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_1_2,(I should drop by when I have the time.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_10_1,I think it got stuck inside...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_10_2,"Try and go for another one, maybe?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_10_3,I've seen this before. Just whack it a few times.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_10_4,"Do something with your invincible scissors, Chisa."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_10_5,I've got a better way to handle no-good vending machines like this.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_10_6,Yep. You've read my mind.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_10_7,"That may be a little too much. Here, watch this."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_1,Here you go. Simplicity works best.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_2,...Is something wrong?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_3,Didn't have time for this kind of thing before.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_4,Just wondering if it's past its expiration date.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_5,You're right. We were always running from something. Or chasing after something.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_6,"Remember that canned fruit we had that one night? It's the same thing. I've never got an upset stomach from it, at least."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_7,"Before I transferred to Startorch, I used to hide next to the vending machines behind my high school building all the time."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_8,No one else really went there. It was quiet. The sound of soda cans dropping down would make me feel relaxed.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_9,Was life difficult back then?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_10,"Where I come from, discrimination and prejudice against Resonators are part of life. School was no exception."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_11,"The gossip, the looks, the way people kept their distance... intentional or not, it still got to me."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_12,"I tried to stand up for myself. I tried holding it in. Nothing changed. Just when I was close to breaking, I received an acceptance letter."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_13,"And so, with my family's blessing, I left home and went to Startorch Academy, far away in the Lahai-Roi region."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_14,Startorch Academy... What was it like?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_15,"So it's true, you... No, it's nothing."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_16,It is a multinational school built specifically for Resonators. A metropolis of science and research.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_17,"Even for a girl who couldn't face her own problems and chose to run away, they accepted me with a warm welcome. I met people who dreamed of reaching the stars."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_18,This swing... It's just like the one back home.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_20,Would you join me? There is room for one more.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_11_21,Was it because you're a Resonator?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_12_1,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_12_2,Chisa?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_12_3,Solaris to Chisa.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_12_4,I hear you. I'm just... enjoying the gentle sway. Especially... when someone's beside me.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_12_5,Everything feels so peaceful all of a sudden.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_12_6,"When you're ready to move on, I'll get up."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_13_1,You don't have to wait for me. I think I've been on the swing long enough.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_14_1,"Oh, you're back. Do you like sitting on the swing too?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_15_1,I can already see our destination from here. Look at the cherry blossoms... they weren't blooming like this before.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_15_3,They really are beautiful now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_15_4,They're the same as they were before.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_15_5,"Like clouds floating above the water, or like cotton poking through a torn couch... Sorry, I'm using weird analogies again."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_15_6,It could be that my mood is just different now than before.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_15_7,"Luckily, a view like this can exist forever within this Sonoro Sphere."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_16_1,That fountain over there... it's been concealed by leftover Irideglow Crystals. Kind of a shame.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_16_2,I'll take care of it. Just like back in Neon Tower.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_1,There's something in the water...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_2,Let's fish it out and see what it is.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_3,This looks like a cassette tape.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_4,"Ah, I know what it is."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_5,Every Startorch Academy student has a frequency storage cassette like this inside their Terminals.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_6,(I remember now. Galbrena once told me about them.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_7,I also have one in my Terminal. They were given out during the orientation.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_8,"If it's a device unique to Lahai-Roi, what's it doing here?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_9,"Random ""castaways"" often appear inside the Honami Sonoro Sphere. This must be one of those."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_10,I'll take this to Namipon. It should be able to help us find where it came from.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_11,Cherry blossoms... Right in front of us. It's so beautiful.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_12,Let's go over there and take a picture.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_13,This right here is a photo moment.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_17_14,Sure. You and I together.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_18_1,Make sure you look towards the camera.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_18_2,I will.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_1,"When I was little, my parents once took me to a park full of cherry blossoms for a picnic. I made kirigami in all kinds of shapes and had them guess what they were."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_2,"The kirigami didn't really look like anything, but when I told them, they'd always smile and pretend they understood."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_3,"Those cherry blossoms... they looked just like they do now. After being away from home for so long, drifting around... I feel like I'm home again."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_4,"Welcome home, Chisa."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_5,"Thank you, Senpai."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_6,"This student ID card came into my possession by chance. It was in that Tower that I found—No, that I recognized who it belonged to."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_7,"I never found the right moment to return this to you. Here, this belongs to you."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_8,I was a student at Startorch Academy?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_9,They told me about you at the Black Shores. That you've lost some memories.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_10,"We never met in person at school, but... I did read the course selection guide you wrote."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_11,I don't remember anything.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_12,It's okay. Honami is where we first met each other.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_13,But I've been talking about myself this whole time. Why don't you tell me about your story so far? I'd like to know more about you.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_14,"Rinascita... sounds like quite an adventure. Only someone like you, Senpai, could accomplish so much."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_15,You can stop calling me that for now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_16,"Hold on, that title takes a little getting used to."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_17,"Alright. You always seem to find your way forward, no matter how uncertain things are. Like you did in Honami. But I..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_18,What comes next? Should I continue my studies at the Academy? Should I go home? Or should I do something else... I still haven't decided.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_19,No need to rush your decision. You can take your time and stick around here for a while.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_20,"At least, you won't have to face the future alone anymore."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_21,You're right. We're partners.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_22,I received a precious gift while traveling with you—the courage to face reality and move on.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_23,"There's something else I want to give you besides the ID card, {PlayerName}."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_24,"I was out of inspiration towards the end, but finally managed to finish it after coming back to Honami and getting some ideas."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_25,So this is what you were working on during recovery.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_26,"Yes. It's a pretty tricky piece, so I ended up using a lot of paper. Looks very much like Honami, don't you think?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_27,"My hometown was built next to the Tacet Field created by Honami's fall. Even though the Lament still haunts us, some stubborn souls have rebuilt that familiar Tower again."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_28,We still reach for the sky. Still hope radio waves break through the blockade to connect the isolated regions left behind...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_29,"The painful memories of home will never fade. But I won't turn away from the beautiful ones, either. Together... they are what make me Kuchiba Chisa."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_30,This is my thank-you gift to you. Something precious to me... A memory of my home.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_31,I'll hold on to it.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_32,I just remembered... Namipon always said the cafe needed more life. Maybe now is the time to try?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_33,"Like you said, I have time to ""stick around"" for a while. So would it be alright if I invite your friends from the Black Shores here for a party?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_34,"Before I make any decisions on what to do next, I want Shashou Cafe to celebrate a real ""opening day."""
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_35,"Under the cherry blossoms, Chisa returns your old student ID, revealing that you too once attended Startorch Academy in the past. Still, what matters more to her is the you she met in Honami, and she wants to know you better. You tell her stories of your adventures in Rinascita, and she confides her own uncertainties about the future. Your response moves her, and she says she's drawn strength from the journey you've shared. She then gives you a gift: an intricate kirigami of her hometown she made during her recovery in the Black Shores. A piece filled with feeling and memory. Finally, she suggests inviting your Black Shores friends to the cafe to celebrate a real ""opening day."""
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_36,"Pink petals swirl upon the wind like drifting thoughts, gently filling the space between hearts."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_19_37,"Why not stay a little longer, in this long season, along the streets we once walked, here in Honami..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_1,"Ah, {PlayerName}. Perfect timing. There's something you need to know."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_2,"Since we took charge of the Honami Sonoro Sphere, we've been noticing some changes on the inside—"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_3,"The link between Honami and the real world is stabilizing, and the city's time flow is almost in sync."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_4,But scans from Tethys indicate that much of the recent frequency exchanges weren't passing through this rift.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_5,Meaning?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_6,"Meaning it could either just be a misreading due to overlapping data, or... there's another access point to the Honami Sonoro Sphere."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_7,"On top of that, the city's buzzing with unidentified phenomena and unconfirmed hazard zones. We'll continue to monitor them closely and run further analysis."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_8,"By the way, how's Chisa doing?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_9,"She's just completed her treatment. Everything seems to be all right. Her Rabelle's Curve is within normal parameters, and there are no significant lingering Overclocking symptoms."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_10,"That said, I don't recommend repeating what happened in Honami. That level of Resonance strain is unsustainable."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_11,"Ah, excuse me."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_12,...Yes. Mm-hmm. Got it. {Male=He;Female=She}'s with me right now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_13,I just got a call that Chisa submitted an itinerary not long ago and left for Honami alone.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_14,Why would she go back?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_15,"She didn't specify. All she wrote was ""I want to go back."""
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_16,You can find her guide KU-Roro in the Haven of Sprouts. It may know something.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_17,"I'll go check it out. Knowing Chisa, she usually doesn't act without purpose."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_18,"Some time later, you return to the Black Shores to visit Chisa. Valentina tells you that the connection between Honami's Sonoro and the real world is stabilizing. Chisa has completed her treatment and shows no serious lingering Overclocking symptoms. However, she recently went back to Honami alone for reasons unknown. Her guide, KU-Shosho, might know more."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_2_19,"With Chisa's treatment over, you once again return to the Black Shores..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_1,"So, do you want to hang around a bit longer, or shall we head back? I'll follow your lead."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_2,There's something I want to ask.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_4,It's getting late. Let's head back to the cafe.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_5,Is there something else you'd like to know? We've got plenty of time.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_6,About your Overclocking symptoms...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_7,About when I was a student at Startorch Academy...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_8,About that cassette tape...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_9,That's it for now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_10,Are you worried about me? I'm feeling all right for the time being.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_11,"Not pretending to be okay, right?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_12,Not when I'm with you. The people at the Black Shores called it a miracle. That someone who was on the verge of Overclocking for so long could recover. But...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_13,"When we passed through Honami's rift, I felt a warm frequency flowing toward me. I suspect that's what helped stabilize my Resonance energy."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_14,Was it...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_15,"It was the person who brought you to Honami... In the end, the same person pulled me back from the edge. Again."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_16,I'm sorry. I was only a first-year student in Engineering. I hadn't been around long enough. Everything I heard about you came from what others said.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_17,"All I really heard was that you were popular. Always had friends around. If I hadn't been caught in the Honami incident, we probably would've never met."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_18,The ones from Startorch aren't the average cassettes that you normally see. They are specialized equipment used to store frequencies.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_19,"One of the instructors described it as a frequency backup storage for the holder. It records the person's very ""existence."""
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_20,Why make backups of frequencies?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_21,It's one of the Academy's safety precautions against the <te href=850080>Waveworn Phenomenon</te>. That is all that I know.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_20_22,"Come on, then. We should spruce the place up a bit to give our friends a warm welcome."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_1,"Anything else you'd like to know? As long as it's within my authority, I can answer."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_2,About Honami's time flow...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_3,About Chisa's stay at the Black Shores...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_4,About the Bloom Bearer Sumika...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_5,That's all for now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_6,"After Honami was devastated, energy from the Lament sealed the entire city into a unique Sonoro Sphere like congealed amber. Its time flow was slowed down compared to the rest of the world."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_7,A similar case would be Mt. Firmament. Being on the inside for a day means up to a hundred days might have passed on the outside.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_8,"But it's not permanent. As Honami's connection to reality grows stronger, the flow of time begins to restore itself."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_9,"You getting sucked into Honami through that rift has got Shorekeeper worried sick, and she's been closely monitoring everything that's going on over there since."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_10,"Good thing is, at that point, Honami's time flow was no longer that different from the real world. So to us, you were only gone for just a bit."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_11,"While she was recovering, Chisa applied for partial access to the Black Shores database, mainly to learn general knowledge and modern trends."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_12,"We also saw her strolling around the living area and taking a look at the facilities occasionally, just like a lot of the New Branches when they first get here."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_13,The KU-Roro responsible for taking care of her can fill you in if you want to know more.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_14,"Sumika is a member of the Black Shores who went M.I.A. many years ago. We dispatched a team on a search and rescue, but nothing solid came of it."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_15,The report Chisa submitted to us has detailed Sumika's operations and engagements in Honami.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_16,"She was one of the most outstanding researchers of the Error Cell, and an elite Bloom Bearer who made the Black Shores proud."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_3_17,The Stellar Matrix will forever remember her noble pursuit of truth.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_30_2,"Come to think of it, this is the first time I'm here at this cafe while wide awake."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_30_3,You sure it's not because you've been putting in more nap hours lately?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_30_4,"Says who? I got locked out by the Sonoro Sphere right from the start, remember? I couldn't even get to you. And don't get me started on all the wacky frequencies that I got mixed in with..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_30_5,"You did a great job. Welcome to Shashou Cafe, Abby."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_30_6,"...Whoa, why the formality all of a sudden? Ahem. So you asked Shorekeeper to invite the Black Shores gang over for a party. They should be here pretty soon, right?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_30_7,Yep. Let's go check on Chisa and see how the decorating is going.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_1,"Gotta hand it to ya, I love what you guys did with the place. Feels like a mini festival in here!"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_2,"Oh, you're here. Namipon and I are just making finishing touches to the party."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_3,"Welcome aboard, Abby."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_4,"Well, hello there, Chisa. It's nice to see you again. You're all so kind, you know. Say, whatcha got on the menu—"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_5,"In the cozy cafe, vibrant lights dance on the walls. Soft chimes whisper. Glad to have you aboard again, Passenger."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_6,"Chisa's the Acting Manager today, and she'll be our host for the opening party."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_7,Wait a minute... Something smells funny about this guy!
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_8,This frequency isn't Echo or TD. Feels like it's hiding a whole mixed bag in its fuzzy tummy!
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_9,It's the cafe's mascot.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_10,It's the guardian of Honami City.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_11,"You say that, but I don't trust it. Hey, ain't there a whole lot more of you around here too?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_12,"Would you like to join us in putting up the decorations, Passenger?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_13,Gladly.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_14,Love to help.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_15,And it's completely ignoring me! Now it even chats up {PlayerName} like they're old buddies or something...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_16,"Ah, the place is starting to turn into a party now."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_17,Is something wrong with your friend?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_18,No idea.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_19,"Abby's just a little excited today, that's all."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_20,"After being an emergency shelter for so long, it's finally starting to become what it was supposed to be."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_31_21,"I'll let you finish these last few decorations, {PlayerName}."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_32_1,"Passenger, Chisa was the one who proposed the party. She has put lots of effort into preparations."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_32_2,"For this, I'd like to prepare a surprise—a special ornament just for her. Any recommendations?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_32_3,Maybe something related to her?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_32_4,Maybe something that she likes?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_32_5,Agreed. It must be something that would let all the Passengers know Chisa is the manager of the day at first glance.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_32_6,"Ah, yes. It must be something that Chisa would fall in love with immediately."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_32_7,"And just like that, after a little tinkering here and some cuts there, Namipon hands you the ornament it just finished…"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_1,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_2,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_3,What's... this?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_4,"Oh, it's a standee of the cafe's manager. I made it with the lingering frequencies around."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_5,"{PlayerName}, do you like... No, what do you think of it?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_6,As stylish as the original.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_7,As cute as the original.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_8,Fits in perfectly with everything around it.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_9,You even included my weapon... Let's leave it here then.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_10,"Did you say... c-cute? Um, I guess just leave it like this, then."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_33_11,"If you think it fits, then... alright."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_34_1,"Ah, this was left here by Passenger 3."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_34_2,Passenger 3?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_34_3,Passenger 1 is Chisa. You're Passenger 2. As for Passenger 3... Ahem...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_34_4,Passenger 3 is the relentless seeker of truth. She never gave up her quest.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_35_1,"This appears to be a gallery set up by Chisa. It displays scenes from around Honami, and pictures she took with people she holds dear..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_36_1,"*Light, upbeat melody*"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_36_2,"Good afternoon, Honami. You're tuned in to your city radio, broadcasting live on a warm summer breeze."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_36_3,"As the temps slowly climb, looks like that midsummer heat is comin' in hot. But don't sweat it. Up next, we've got a special announcement."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_36_4,"Our meteor trackers are lighting up. Looks like a shower is set to dazzle just after midnight tonight. For anyone up for a little stargazing, grab your friends and family to catch this ""Midnight Summer Magic Show."""
Main_Honami_2_8_2_36_5,"Coming up next, here's a list of the best viewing spots across the city..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_36_6,(So the seasons in Honami that stood still are flowing again...)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_1,Maintain eye contact... Smile... Greet everyone as they come in...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_2,Feeling a bit nervous?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_3,"Hello, Acting Manager. You there?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_4,A little bit. I'm... I'm just reviewing the basics of greeting guests.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_5,I'm listening. I'm just reviewing the basics of greeting guests.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_6,"Shashou Cafe is like ""home"" to me in Honami. Honestly, i-it's been a long time since I hosted anyone at home."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_7,I think the last time was… sometime in high school.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_8,Just greet everyone like you'd greet me.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_9,"To me, you're different from everyone else."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_10,I-I didn't give it much thought at the time. Anyway... I need to pull myself together. A manager must stay composed.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_11,You greeted me just fine.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_37_12,Different?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_38_1,"Thank you for lending us a hand with the decorations, Passenger. I'm sure the others will be very pleased."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_38_2,(Have a look around the cafe.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_38_3,(Wait for your friends to arrive.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_2,"No, not at all. We're glad you made it, Shorekeeper. Shasho Cafe welcomes you aboard!"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_3,I see.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_4,Mmm...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_5,"Oh, say something, Passenger. This awkward silence is killing me..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_6,Sounds like you two already met at the Black Shores.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_7,Yes. Shorekeeper personally oversaw all of the routine checkups during my recovery. She was very helpful.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_8,Chisa remained on the verge of Overlocking for a prolonged period within a distorted temporal flow. Her case required a full evaluation by the Tethys System.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_9,Now it's suddenly turned into a conversation about work...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_10,"Hi, Boss! Heard you bought the whole place out?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_11,She's the manager.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_12,I'm just a customer like you are.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_13,"Very good lah! My reading for you said visitors from all around, wealth coming in thick and fast. Super lucky day for an opening!"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_14,You must be Buling?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_15,I've heard about you from {PlayerName}. You're the one who helped pinpoint Honami's rift. Thank you.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_16,"It's no biggie. Me and Boss, we go way back. Just treat me to a good meal and we're even."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_17,"Good to meet you, Chisa. And this floating one here... Hmm..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_18,I'm the cafe's mascot. Call me Namipon.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_19,"Hello, Namipon. You show the way? Been walking until my legs go jelly. Need to sit and rest a while."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_35,"{PlayerName}, Chisa. I have arrived as scheduled."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_39_36,I see you're all waiting here. Could I be mistaken about the time?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_1,"Ah, Bloom Bearer. Ms. Chisa has been gone for some time now."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_2,Did you notice anything strange when she left?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_3,"She was only visiting the nearby facilities, like she normally does. But I had noticed her emotional readings had been low for a while."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_4,"She used to enjoy reading the archives, but in the past few days, I saw her staring off into the distance or performing kirigami."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_5,Kirigami...?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_6,"Ah, yes. Making small art crafts by cutting paper. There are still a few left on this table. She usually always cleaned up afterward, but this time..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_7,(These look like scraps from all the paper cutting. And this one here is a half-finished tower... It looks kind of familiar.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_8,"After submitting her leave, I even asked her if she would like someone to accompany her on her travels, to which she refused."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_9,I see.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_10,I'll go find Chisa.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_11,Please. I leave Ms. Chisa in your care.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_4_12,Kuku... Why did she leave in such a hurry? Should I clean this up?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_40_1,Would you like to start off with something to drink?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_40_2,"Anything would be fine, thank you."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_41_1,Is that...?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_41_2,Oh... No need to mind that.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_41_3,"Very well. I shall follow the proper code of this cafe, and prevent eye contact with your standee."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_41_4,"Wait, I... I didn't mean that."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_1,Why not take a seat?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_2,"It's okay, I'm just admiring the feng shui. Mmm, bright and open, good for drawing in fortune. Hard to find one so lucky."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_3,There's no safer place in all of Honami.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_4,Speaking of Honami... I actually came to see if any special Reverberations were hiding in the city ruins.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_5,But after coming here... It's really quiet. You won't find another place like this in the outside world.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_6,Is that good or bad?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_7,"A good thing, of course."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_8,"It means that lots of ""people"" here let go of whatever they were holding onto. Just poof, all gone!"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_42_9,"...Oh yeah, the coffee beans haven't been changed in ages, right? Next time I'll bring some of my favorite blends for you to try."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_1,Here you go. I hope it's to your liking.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_2,Thank you.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_3,It's... a bit bitter. But nothing I can't bear.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_4,Sounds like it needs more sugar.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_5,How does it compare to the strong tea you had before?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_6,It's all right. I rather think of it as a novelty.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_7,I have to say that the tea was much more bitter.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_8,"Now then... {PlayerName}, Chisa. The Black Shores has conducted another investigation on Startorch Academy, the school that you both once attended."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_9,"As of now, we can confirm that the Academy, along with the entire region of Lahai-Roi, has been completely isolated from the rest of the world by the <te href=851070>Void Storm</te>."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_10,The Void Storm?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_11,"A Waveworn Phenomenon unique to Lahai-Roi. When it's active, any form of communication is blocked."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_12,So you're saying... right now there's no way for us to reach the Academy?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_13,"Oh, you're all here. How come I wasn't invited to the party?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_14,I thought you couldn't make it.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_15,Don't be silly. Seeing you is always my No. 1 priority.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_16,"Camellya, shouldn't you be on a mission?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_17,Got it done early. And I would've finished it even sooner if someone had told me a city popped up off the coast of the Black Shores.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_18,So... you must be Chisa?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_19,...Hello.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_20,"I saw the report on Honami. Oh, it's such a shame I wasn't there for the excitement."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_43_21,"You wouldn't mind having an extra girl at your party, would you? I'd like to make up for all the fun I missed."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_1,"A city doomed to be destroyed again and again. Irideglow that triggers Overclocking, and TDs tearing through the streets..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_2,But never mind that. You're here. I'm here. The two of us can dance... doesn't that sound a lot more fun?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_3,"Oh, {PlayerName}. If I got pulled in too, how much more fun would that have been!"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_4,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_5,Don't get ahead of yourself. The crisis is over.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_6,"I'll take it as a yes, then."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_7,"Fine, if you say so. I'll take those extra performances off the table, then."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_8,"Anyway, pushing through the pain of Overclocking and mastering the shiver of death clawing at your spine... I spy with my little eye a promising seed."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_9,"Interested in trying a little ""germination test,"" Chisa? A little eval I host, just for the brave."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_10,Eval as in...?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_11,"Defeat me, or be defeated."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_12,Is this... some kind of tradition in the Black Shores?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_13,"Relax, dearie. Don't get worked up just yet. Hehe, you can show me your dance moves once you're fully recovered."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_44_14,"Camellya imagines how exciting it would have been to explore Honami with you, saying she wishes she had been dragged into the crisis with you. Seeing Chisa's potential, she invites her to take part in the ""germination test"" she will hold once Chisa has fully recovered."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_45_1,"Nom-nom-nom. Ya know, it must be really rough for you. Having your frequency get split into pieces like that, and then clearing your head of all the clicking and buzzing."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_45_2,That's all in the past now. How's the Rice Dango?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_45_3,"Not bad, actually. Soft and chewy. Well... I guess I shouldn't have judged a Namipon by its smell."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_45_4,"Plus, you've been a big help to {PlayerName} these past few days. I'll come give you a hand after I'm done with this Dango."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_45_5,That's lovely! We'll take all the help we can get.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_46_1,We... doing food prep for the party... Huge cake for opening... Keep up the good work... Yay...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_46_2,Where did all this food come from?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_46_3,Big-pon helped gather them... All local pure Remnants... 100% natural... Additive free...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_1,"*Light, upbeat melody*"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_2,...We have a special guest with us today—
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_3,"Well hello to all the lovely listeners of the Pioneer Podcast. It's your old pal, Aalto."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_4,"Glad to have you. Mr. Aalto, why don't you start us off with the Lilyland incident?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_5,"It all happened during the Troupe of Fools' big tour. Tickets were already pretty cheap, but scalpers hogged them all and were ripping off unsuspecting fans."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_6,"Not the first time they've done something like this, actually."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_7,"After Brant, the head of the Troupe, found out about it, he put on a disguise one night and snuck into their hideout. ""Retrieved"" all the tickets and bills as evidence right under their noses."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_8,It was bye-bye scalpers! Brant offered free tickets to all the fans that came to watch their play. Such a happy ending.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_9,"Well it sounds awfully like Brant did most of the work, Mr. Aalto. So... So what exactly was your role in all of this?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_10,"Ah-ha-ha... Well, I supplied Brant with intel on the hideout, of course. I was undercover and it all happened right in front of me."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_11,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_47_12,(So this radio can receive signals from outside of Honami now?)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_48_1,"Everyone's here, and the food and drinks are almost ready. Shall we start the party?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_48_2,Let's get this party started.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_48_3,In a bit.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_5_1,"Now then, I believe it's safe to say I can finally go for a recharge..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_1,Photo time's over.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_2,"Do the honors, Acting Manager."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_3,Mmm-hmm.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_4,"(In this Honami summer night, I wish—)"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_5,(For the moments spent with friends to last forever.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_6,Hey!
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_7,Gimme that.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_8,MINE!
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_9,Whoa!
Main_Honami_2_8_2_50_10,Careful!
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_1,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_2,What's the matter?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_3,Are the others on their way?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_4,"From the guest list you provided, only Encore, Buling, and myself were free to come. The others are either away or currently on assignment."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_5,Encore... She locked herself in her room and insisted on finishing Tethys's assigned homework.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_6,I can't imagine how much homework that must be...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_7,Tell her it's time for another holiday.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_8,"Apologies. I didn't expect her to suddenly become so... competitive. It's a first, truly."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_9,"That I tried. Encore kept insisting she finish it, even remarking, ""Your time has come, big bad homework!"""
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_10,"Yeah, that's Encore alright..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_11,Is Encore that little girl with pink hair? I helped her with some math problems over at the Haven of Sprouts once.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_12,She's a quick learner. She understood all the formulas I taught her in no time.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_13,So you were Encore's new tutor.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_14,That explains why she's picking a fight with Tethys.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_51_15,There's still time before the party begins. Why don't we go inside and have a seat?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_52_1,Still grumpy about earlier?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_52_2,"As if! I told you, there's something off about that furball. It's like the frequencies of people's emotions all got balled up together like a... like a wad of bubble gum."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_52_3,But then again... I didn't pick up anything bad from it though.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_52_4,"Be nice to the mascot, Abby."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_52_5,"A-Alright, alright, if you say so. I guess a chat wouldn't hurt."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_52_6,You'll get along just fine.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_6_1,The Aetherfin shows you a holographic reconstruction of the event that occurred here—
Main_Honami_2_8_2_6_2,"You see a girl looking off into the distance, her eyes lost in the blue sky. What could she be thinking?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_60_1,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_60_2,"You're awake, dear Passenger."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_1,"Anything you'd like to know, Passenger? I'm here to help anytime."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_2,About last night's view...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_3,About what happened after the party...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_4,That's it for now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_5,"Mmm, it was the surprise ""we"" prepared, and Honami's way of answering everyone's wishes."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_6,"The city is free from its sorrow. Time isn't stuck anymore. That was... a little epilogue after the ""real ending."" And a happy one."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_7,Actually... we had a big meteorite scare. Their original trajectory would have wiped out the whole Crossing.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_8,But you and Chisa gathered everyone's strength and turned that big scary rock… into a sky full of stardust…
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_9,"Then you curled up here in the cafe and took a nice, long nap. Chisa woke up first and watched you sleeping for a while."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_10,You sure that's what happened?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_11,"Wait a minute, are you making this up?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_61_12,"Oops, guess you got me there. But that last part is true, though."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_62_1,The wall is covered with pictures from Shashou Cafe's opening day—
Main_Honami_2_8_2_62_2,"Although the time you spent with your friends was short, every moment was captured forever. Now it feels clear and close enough to see and touch."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_1,"Good morning, {PlayerName}."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_2,"Good morning, Chisa."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_3,"Can I get you something to drink, Passenger?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_4,It feels like we're back to our adventuring days in Honami.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_5,I already had a cup of coffee this morning. And please stop trying to be Namipon.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_6,That was a perfect wrap for our opening party. It was a very special night.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_7,"A fitting conclusion for everything that's happened over the past two months, a celebration for the cafe's opening, and... a commemoration for meeting new friends."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_8,"Even if we were to say farewell now, I wouldn't have any regrets."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_9,Farewell?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_10,So you've made a decision?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_11,Yes. I have decided what I'll do next.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_12,"I will return home first and find my parents. After that, Startorch Academy, to complete my studies."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_13,"Neither will be easy, but I will overcome whatever stands in my way, just like... how we did together in that Tower."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_14,"""Nothing can trap me... I'll find my way back."""
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_15,That's right. Nothing can stop you.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_16,"We'll be going our separate ways for a while. But I'm sure when this is all over, you and I will see each other again."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_17,"No... when the time comes, I promise I'll come looking for you."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_18,"Then again, I won't be leaving right away. The Black Shores still wants me back for a few health checkups."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_19,What do you say I join the Black Shores during this time just like Camellya suggested?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_20,That one was a joke. Now comes the real part.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_63_21,"Thank you, {PlayerName}... Thank you for everything you've done for me."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_64_1,"Whoa, why are your frequencies leaking all over the place?!"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_64_2,Grrr!
Main_Honami_2_8_2_64_3,It's like... something's pulling them out...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_64_4,Is that...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_64_5,Startorch Academy?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_1,Your frequency loss has been contained for now. How are you feeling?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_2,Much better.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_3,Abby's out cold. I think I'm next.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_4,I'm glad to hear that. Your vitals are also within normal parameters now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_5,How can that be...? The readings tell me your vitals are within normal parameters now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_6,"Hey, I'm still wide awake ya know, just a little beat. And this part of you feels completely empty."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_7,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_8,The connection between your frequency and the rift has been cut off. You are out of immediate danger.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_9,Why did my frequency start to dissipate?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_10,What was trying to siphon my frequency?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_11,We are unable to confirm at this time. But frequency signatures identical to the <te href=851070>Void Storm</te> were detected in the rift's proximity.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_12,"The most likely scenario is that this rift is acting as a conduit between here and the Lahai-Roi region, which is also where your frequency was drawn to."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_13,Lahai-Roi is where it all started. Guess we'll need to pay the place a visit to find out the actual cause.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_14,The Void Storm at Startorch was what brought me to Honami in the first place. Now it's the other way around.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_15,Do you suppose this rift can take us straight to Lahai-Roi?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_16,...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_17,Is that a viable option?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_18,"Theoretically, yes. However, the frequencies inside the rift are highly unstable, and you are likely to lose your way without proper navigation."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_19,I'm afraid now is not the appropriate time.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_65_20,"Ugh, this part of you feels completely empty. Let me check that out for you."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_66_1,"Phew, never thought I'd actually be here, standing in the post-apocalyptic city from the storybooks I read when I was a kid."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_66_2,Hello?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_66_3,"Hi, there, Bloom Bearer. I've collected some frequency samples and am analyzing them now."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_66_4,Got anything so far?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_66_5,"Yep. Aside from the Void Storm readings we got around the rift, we also found scattered foreign frequencies in the vicinity."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_66_6,"What might have happened is that frequencies from another region got ""spat out"" into Honami when the rift was formed."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_66_7,Another region... as in Lahai-Roi?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_66_8,"That's right. We still need to verify their exact origins, but the general areas are pretty much narrowed down."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_67_1,"""Safety risk, moderate. Further surveillance is needed."" That'll do as the report for Valentina for now."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_67_2,Notice anything unusual?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_67_3,"The rift seems to be in a stasis. No Tacet Discords popping out of it, at least."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_67_4,But I've recognized a few flashing images within the rift.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_67_5,Is it Startorch Academy?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_67_6,Yes. Most information about that school is highly classified.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_67_7,"I only know what I do because a friend of mine is an instructor there, but we've been out of touch for a long time."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_68_1,So this is where the radio went...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_68_2,What's with all that noise it's making?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_69_1,"Oh, you're here. Look what I found."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_69_3,"Spotted it next to the rift. Here, listen to this—"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_69_4,This time... we... as our guest.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_69_5,"The thing's not even turned on, but it's been playing these choppy sounds non-stop."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_69_6,"I see the problem here... Try adjusting its receiver, Passenger."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_1,"{PlayerName}, what are you doing here? Are you... looking for me?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_2,There you are.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_3,"Well, someone left her sick bed, so I came to check on her."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_4,I'm sorry for not staying at the Black Shores and resting as I should.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_5,What made you decide to come back?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_6,But these are just conditions that made this possible. As for the true reason...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_7,I wanted to see what's become of Honami... since the loop ended.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_8,"Strolling through the streets, I realize that this is my first time seeing the city as a tourist, despite being trapped here for months."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_9,"No more worrying when the next Lament will come. No more desperate reach for Neon Tower. Now, I can simply wander around. No burdens."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_10,The Lament left scars. They won't fade. But what was once frozen in time... seems to be moving again.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_11,This is the new future that we and everyone who once lived here forged together.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_12,"A new... future, you say?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_13,"By the way, I asked the Black Shores to help me verify the academy I once attended and dig into my records."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_14,"They didn't reach the school directly, but... I found out something. I was in Honami for around two months. Outside, over twenty years have passed."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_15,Kuchiba Chisa... was a first-year student at <te href=851069>Startorch Academy</te> over twenty years ago.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_16,...Over twenty years ago?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_17,"Yes. I had a feeling this would be the case when Sumika mentioned her findings, but I didn't expect such a huge time difference."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_18,The nice orientation ceremony... still feels recent. But the classmates I met have long since graduated.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_19,"When I tried to contact my parents back home, I realized there was no way for me to reach them at all."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_20,Where are they? What have they been doing? How will they react if they find out that their daughter is still alive... I have no way of knowing.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_21,Now this place feels more like home than the world out there.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_22,It just takes some time to get used to an unfamiliar environment.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_23,"Since you're here, would you walk with me? I'd like to see what Honami looks like now... together."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_24,Any particular places you have in mind?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_25,"I haven't come up with an exact plan yet. Specific routes, time of travel, rest locations... None."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_26,Just as I thought. I'm not my usual self today.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_27,"Hey, it's just a ""weekend getaway."" No plans needed. Just get up and go."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_28,If you put it that way...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_29,How about that lake surrounded by cherry blossoms?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_30,"I'm in stable shape, and the Black Shores approved my temporary travel."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_7_31,"Just ask the Black Shores to help you keep digging. With enough time, you're bound to find those connections again."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_1,Something's probably broken inside. I'll take a look.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_2,"Namipon, was that a live signal from Lahai-Roi?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_3,"Yes, it was. That cassette we put inside lets it receive radio signals from the rift."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_4,"With the right tweak, maybe I can track it. Like I did with Neon Tower's—"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_5,It sounded like the Academy's radio talk show... But why did I hear my mother?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_6,Does that mean she's at Startorch? Why is she there? Is she... looking for me?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_7,Chisa?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_8,(Chisa will need some time to process everything.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_9,I am detecting a unique frequency from this radio...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_10,It has formed a connection with Lahai-Roi on the other end of the rift.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_11,"Once it's all fixed up, I can piggyback on this frequency and plot coordinates from there to Honami."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_12,"Understood. With established coordinates, you will be able to navigate your way within the rift."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_13,The Black Shores will also assist with stabilizing the rift to ensure your safety as much as possible.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_14,...Should you decide to travel to Lahai-Roi. To Startorch Academy.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_15,What do you know about Lahai-Roi?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_16,Lahai-Roi has been mentioned a lot in passing lately.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_17,"It is a region once forgotten, covered in snow most of the year and sparsely populated. No Sentinel is there to guide its civilization."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_18,"Beneath its ice fields lie Startorch Academy and numerous research facilities, built by a multinational alliance known as the <te href=851071>Spacetrek Collective</te>."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_19,Startorch Academy enacts a strict access protocol for all personnel. I will have the necessary paperwork in place before your departure.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_20,Looks like I need to make changes to my plans...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_21,I want to go back to Startorch Academy.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_22,"My family is there, and so are my instructors and classmates. The future may be uncertain, but I know what I have to do."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_23,We'll find the missing frequencies.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_24,We'll find out the truth.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_25,We'll return to the Academy we attended.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_26,"Now, we wait. And then..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_27,We get through this together.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_28,*Static noises*
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_29,*Static*... The universe... has rejected us...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_30,"...Is this the answer you've been seeking, {PlayerName}?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_70_31,I hope to make you proud. I hope I haven't let you down...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_1,"Is something wrong, {PlayerName}? Why did you turn back?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_2,I heard a voice on the radio just now.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_3,I heard someone calling my name.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_4,A voice from the radio? But isn't it broken?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_5,"You did? I'm right next to you, but... I don't think I heard anything."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_6,You sure you didn't hear anything strange?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_7,Yes. You must be exhausted. Should we go back to the cafe?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_8,I guess I could use some rest.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_9,No need. I'm fine.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_71_10,(I don't think I was imagining it... that voice.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_1,"Next up... Ehhh, gotta fix this radio."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_2,"So you and Chisa can get to school okay, I'm gonna use... a dozen Rice Dangos' worth of effort."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_3,It'll be an investigation. We're not going to school.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_4,That's a strange unit of measurement...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_5,"Okay, okay. When you get to Lahai-Roi, take care of each other, alright?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_6,Are you really not coming with us?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_7,Nope. I'm a Namipon from Honami. This is where I stay.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_8,I'll look after the cafe while you're away. It'll always be here when you need to rest.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_9,"Oh, man... Why you gotta bring up the emotional talk out of the blue?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_72_10,It means I'm trying really hard.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_73_1,I will be using my powers to stabilize the rift's channel.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_73_2,Did you hear any voices on the radio earlier?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_73_3,"No, to my ears the radio has been silent."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_73_4,"However, I was able to sense a peculiar frequency for a brief moment."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_73_5,"It felt independent from the Honami Sonoro Sphere, as if... it existed beyond a singular dimension."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_1,"I remember this Crossing. When I was little, my younger sister and I once snuck out to play in the shopping mall. Oh, we had a blast that whole afternoon..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_2,So Honami is your hometown?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_3,"Yes, it is. I was on a train leaving Honami when the Lament struck. I, uh... I had a fight with my parents."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_4,I'm sorry.
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_5,You still look really young...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_6,"Oh, don't be. That was years ago."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_7,"My Resonance ability might not be the strongest out there, but it gives me plenty of time to feel the world."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_8,"In the real world, all that's left of Honami is this giant Tacet Field. But inside this Sonoro Sphere, it still exists."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_74_9,"To me, the things I need to do stay the same. Collect Reverberations, analyze traces of the Lament, and then... search for the truth."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_1,Did I... fall asleep?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_2,"Yes, you did. Everyone had a fantastic time last night."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_3,"After saying goodbye to your friends, you got tired and decided to take a rest in the cafe."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_4,(I did...?)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_5,(The only thing I remember is what happened right before watching the meteor shower.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_6,What's the matter? Did you not sleep well?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_7,Where's Chisa?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_8,Chisa...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_75_9,"Hehe, Chisa woke up before you. She tiptoed out for some fresh air. Said she didn't want to bother you."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_1,"If not mistaken, the sounds will become clearer once you've adjusted it to the right frequency."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_2,(Let's give this a try then.)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_3,(Adjust the knob clockwise)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_4,(Adjust the knob counter-clockwise)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_5,"Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Try the other way."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_6,(In that case...)
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_7,"Oh, oh! There you go!"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_8,"*Static*... Mrs. Kuchiba, would you mind sharing with us why you chose this particular design... *static*... of the Academy's new uniform?"
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_9,Huh?
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_10,"The inspiration came from... well, my daughter. She once made a cutout of this pattern from some old fabric at home..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_11,...Very interesting... *static*... It really captures the Academy's spirit...
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_12,"*Static*... If it's this uniform, I thought... my little Chisa would love to wear it..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_13,*Loud whistle*
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_14,*Complete silence*
Main_Honami_2_8_2_76_15,"After some tuning, the signal clears. The broadcast is an interview about school uniforms, and Chisa recognizes who the guest speaker is..."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_8_1,"I've never mentioned it before, but the buildings and infrastructure here... they remind me of the neighborhood I grew up in."
Main_Honami_2_8_2_8_2,Brings back old memories?

Shixifeidu_main_2_8_25_1,Space has just been sliced again.
Shixifeidu_main_2_8_25_7,"The temperature's dropping, but there's no frost or ice anywhere. Could it mean this ""Tower"" really is absorbing warmth from human bodies, just like Sumika suspected?"
