Event_XZPLW_1_1,"KuKu, good to see you again, Bloom Bearer."
Event_XZPLW_1_2,Do you remember me? I'm the Tethys Terminal assigned to look after Ms. Chisa.
Event_XZPLW_1_3,What's the matter?
Event_XZPLW_1_4,Did something happen to Chisa?
Event_XZPLW_1_5,Your friend in Honami City asked me to pass along a few words—
Event_XZPLW_1_6,"This time, it's not about Ms. Chisa. In fact, her emotional readings have been high lately. She's now preparing to resume her studies at the Academy."
Event_XZPLW_1_7,Your friend in Honami City asked me to pass along a few words—
Event_XZPLW_1_8,"Passenger, radio repairs are almost done. As for <te href=260004>Lahai-Roi</te>, that region you and Chisa talked about, I've made a discovery."
Event_XZPLW_1_9,"""If you have time, come see me at the cafe."""
Event_XZPLW_1_10,I think I know who that is.
Event_XZPLW_1_11,"So, the coffee-making capybara."
Event_XZPLW_1_12,Ku! My mission here is complete. Good luck on your journey.
Event_XZPLW_10_1,"…Impressive, Stardust. Victory is yours."
Event_XZPLW_10_2,"Your last blow shook me to my very core. But next time, I will win!"
Event_XZPLW_10_3,"Next time, we'll go all out again!"
Event_XZPLW_10_4,Of course. Wait… I feel myself fading.
Event_XZPLW_10_5,So this was it... My final wish... was to fight you properly.
Event_XZPLW_10_6,"...You've remembered now, haven't you? Everyone else has found their path. Now, it's our turn."
Event_XZPLW_10_7,"In this duel called life, let's walk together and shine forth to the future!"
Event_XZPLW_10_8,...
Event_XZPLW_10_9,So… nobody cared about the half-priced bento?
Event_XZPLW_11_1,"...You win, King."
Event_XZPLW_11_2,"Hahahaha! Your strike shook my soul, Stardust. But in the end, the King stands above all."
Event_XZPLW_11_3,"Next time, we'll go all out again!"
Event_XZPLW_11_4,Of course. Wait… I feel myself fading.
Event_XZPLW_11_5,So this was it... My final wish... was to fight you properly.
Event_XZPLW_11_6,"...You've remembered now, haven't you? Everyone else has found their path. Now, it's our turn."
Event_XZPLW_11_7,"In this duel called life, let's walk together and shine forth to the future!"
Event_XZPLW_11_8,...
Event_XZPLW_11_9,So… nobody cared about the half-priced bento?
Event_XZPLW_12_1,"...Incredible, Stardust. You've found a third possibility beyond victory and defeat."
Event_XZPLW_12_2,But it's not enough! A tie cannot shake the King's soul.
Event_XZPLW_12_3,"Tonight, this street has no winner. No one has earned this half-priced bento."
Event_XZPLW_12_4,In that case... let's give it to the one who witnessed our duel.
Event_XZPLW_12_5,"You there, spectator. This half-priced bento belongs to you now."
Event_XZPLW_12_6,What?
Event_XZPLW_12_7,But I didn't even do anything.
Event_XZPLW_12_8,"No, I saw it, the duelist's spirit burning within you."
Event_XZPLW_12_9,"Yes. You must've fought countless soul-shaking battles, haven't you?"
Event_XZPLW_12_10,"Take it, and know you hold the symbol of glory—this half-priced bento!"
Event_XZPLW_13_1,(Deliver the castaway.)
Event_XZPLW_13_2,"Ah, Passenger, you found it! The legendary half-priced bento!"
Event_XZPLW_13_3,...
Event_XZPLW_13_4,What is this half-priced bento anyway?
Event_XZPLW_13_5,"A half-priced bento is a bento that gets marked down late at night, a symbol of rules and hope!"
Event_XZPLW_13_6,"It's the little spark of joy on the shelf when your stomach growls, an oasis you find in the desert of thirst..."
Event_XZPLW_13_7,"Ahem. Anyway, I'll restore the information inside this frequency right away."
Event_XZPLW_15_1,"With a cafeteria this fancy, bringing a bento to class feels pointless..."
Event_XZPLW_15_2,"Oof, now I'm hungry just watching."
Event_XZPLW_16_1,I've got bad news... A package meant for the cafe has gone missing.
Event_XZPLW_16_2,What happened?
Event_XZPLW_16_3,New outfits again?
Event_XZPLW_16_4,"One of us found a castaway outside, and we figured it'd be easier for you if we mailed it straight here."
Event_XZPLW_16_5,"Along the way, a helpful citizen offered to deliver it, but he never showed up."
Event_XZPLW_16_6,That sounds fishy.
Event_XZPLW_16_7,I don't know... but I can track every lost package's location.
Event_XZPLW_16_8,"Right now, it's sitting deep inside the Hanakage Underground Street. Please come with me!"
Event_XZPLW_16_9,"... Are you sure he was just being ""helpful""?"
Event_XZPLW_17_1,"I failed, I failed, I failed, I failed, I failed, I failed, I failed..."
Event_XZPLW_17_2,What's wrong? You look more helpless than helpful now.
Event_XZPLW_17_3,Why did you take the package?
Event_XZPLW_17_4,Could you stop repeating that?
Event_XZPLW_17_5,"Ah, I'm sorry I took this sword… Someone like me doesn't deserve to hold it."
Event_XZPLW_17_6,"I used to run with a gang, living a life of failure. And when I finally managed to find a decent job through an agency, I got fired for being clumsy."
Event_XZPLW_17_7,"To stop my family from worrying, I pretended to go to work every day. But all I did was wander around like a vagrant..."
Event_XZPLW_17_8,"This sword reminded me of when I was a kid, when I was still naively brave. So I wanted… to prove myself."
Event_XZPLW_17_9,I thought I could help people get rid of the monsters in the underground street. It took everything in me just to lure it this far.
Event_XZPLW_17_10,"What kind of fool am I, thinking I could be a hero of justice? I'm long past the age for that."
Event_XZPLW_17_11,You're selling yourself short.
Event_XZPLW_17_12,Your life is not a failure.
Event_XZPLW_17_13,"At least, you still had the courage to hold this sword, didn't you? You've come this far with justice in your heart."
Event_XZPLW_17_14,"…Thank you. Please, take this ""hero's sword."" Do what I couldn't... Finish off those monsters!"
Event_XZPLW_17_15,Request accepted. I'll take care of it for you.
Event_XZPLW_17_16,"Aww, you guys got me emotional… but wait, that's our package in the first place!"
Event_XZPLW_17_17,"Careful, Passenger! I can sense something dangerous ahead."
Event_XZPLW_17_18,But… I couldn't. I couldn't take another step forward... because I didn't have the courage to face it.
Event_XZPLW_18_1,Well done. The underground street will finally see some peace for now.
Event_XZPLW_18_2,Why are you here alone?
Event_XZPLW_18_3,Where's that young man?
Event_XZPLW_18_4,"After you defeated the TD, he vanished with a smile on his face, perhaps knowing his efforts hadn't been in vain."
Event_XZPLW_18_5,"Oh, and in his final moments, he left a message for you..."
Event_XZPLW_18_6,"""What you said made me realize, even with all the bumps in my life, I'm no different from others. We're all just trying to live each day the best we can."""
Event_XZPLW_18_7,"""I still have friends I trust, and a family who cares for me. I think… it's time for me to go home."""
Event_XZPLW_18_8,He came to terms with it in the end.
Event_XZPLW_18_9,…Yes. Anyone who lives each day the best they can is already a hero in their own story.
Event_XZPLW_18_10,"Alright, let's see what Lahai-Roi information is tucked away in here."
Event_XZPLW_18_11,Shouldn't we return to the cafe first?
Event_XZPLW_18_12,Not anymore. <ano=Namipons>We</ano> have made a little upgrade to the Lahai-Roi Frequency Analyzer...
Event_XZPLW_18_13,"From now on, you'll be able to connect to it remotely through your Terminal."
Event_XZPLW_2_1,"Welcome, Passenger! These days, Honami has been flooded with ""castaways"" from Lahai-Roi."
Event_XZPLW_2_2,"By the way, have you ever heard of castaways?"
Event_XZPLW_2_3,Chisa mentioned it before.
Event_XZPLW_2_4,Not that I can recall.
Event_XZPLW_2_5,"That makes it easier. They're things from outside Honami, like the cassette you and Chisa found in the fountain."
Event_XZPLW_2_6,They're frequencies from elsewhere that end up in Honami for all sorts of reasons.
Event_XZPLW_2_7,The cassette you and Chisa found in the fountain was a typical castaway.
Event_XZPLW_2_8,What's bringing more castaways from Lahai-Roi?
Event_XZPLW_2_9,"My guess is that when the rift at the Crossing opened, it ""spat"" them into Honami City."
Event_XZPLW_2_10,"Since Lahai-Roi is your next stop, the information inside those frequencies will definitely be of some use."
Event_XZPLW_2_11,"The problem is… once they reach Honami, their appearance changes."
Event_XZPLW_2_12,Any idea why?
Event_XZPLW_2_13,Hmm... maybe they lose part of their frequency while passing through the rift. Or maybe Honami can't interpret their original form.
Event_XZPLW_2_14,"From what I heard from Chisa, Startorch Academy's technology is two steps ahead of what we have here."
Event_XZPLW_2_15,"So, Honami just reshapes them into something familiar to the Left Behind."
Event_XZPLW_2_16,But I've figured out a way to restore their true form—
Event_XZPLW_2_17,"Pon-pon! Presenting, the Lahai-Roi Frequency Analyzer!"
Event_XZPLW_2_18,...Isn't that the radio?
Event_XZPLW_2_19,...And a monitor from the Black Shores?
Event_XZPLW_2_20,"Hehe, yes... I traded several cups of coffee to borrow this mystical monitor from the Black Shores passengers."
Event_XZPLW_2_21,"The process is simple. Step one, analyze the frequencies with the radio. Step two, reconstruct their images on the display!"
Event_XZPLW_2_22,Relax. I'll handle the technical parts. All you need to do is bring me the castaways.
Event_XZPLW_2_23,And where exactly am I supposed to find them?
Event_XZPLW_2_24,Sounds like a hassle.
Event_XZPLW_2_25,No need to worry. I will provide you with their general locations.
Event_XZPLW_2_26,No hassle. I will provide you with their general locations.
Event_XZPLW_2_27,"In fact, the nearest one is just by the Crossing."
Event_XZPLW_2_28,"Passenger, if you're interested, go take a look."
Event_XZPLW_20_1,The restored image… looks like a very special elevator.
Event_XZPLW_20_2,But why would Honami City interpret it as a sword?
Event_XZPLW_21_1,"Passenger, this is your ever-reliable transport Namipon, here for you rain or shine."
Event_XZPLW_21_2,The castaway this time is...
Event_XZPLW_21_3,This castaway is a very common means of transport in Honami City.
Event_XZPLW_21_4,"I have pinpointed its location. Please, follow me!"
Event_XZPLW_22_1,"You know, Honami used to have an urban legend called the ""Goddess in the Fountain."""
Event_XZPLW_22_2,That fountain looks suspicious. I'm sensing a strange frequency.
Event_XZPLW_23_1,"Tell me, did you drop this Gale Bike, or this Road Bike?"
Event_XZPLW_23_2,...?
Event_XZPLW_23_3,What's the difference?
Event_XZPLW_23_4,"The Gale Bike is very fast. It can climb steep slopes, but it's tough to handle. So it's only for experts."
Event_XZPLW_23_5,"The Road Bike is a bit slower, but much more stable, and you can take it on special lanes. Perfect for normal riders."
Event_XZPLW_23_6,I'm a pro cyclist.
Event_XZPLW_23_7,The regular one will do for me.
Event_XZPLW_23_8,"Oops, there's only one bike left. But it's still a solid ride, far better than any cheap knock-off."
Event_XZPLW_23_9,"(Obviously, this voice is not coming from the fountain...)"
Event_XZPLW_24_1,Sigh… I knew I couldn't hide from you.
Event_XZPLW_24_2,"…Sorry, I wasn't trying to prank anyone. I just wanted to help advertise my family's bike shop."
Event_XZPLW_24_3,Advertise?
Event_XZPLW_24_4,"Yes. My dad runs the shop all by himself, but lately, business has been slow."
Event_XZPLW_24_5,...Everyone's switching to cars or the subway. Maybe no one wants bikes anymore?
Event_XZPLW_24_6,"Not at all. Times may shift, and fashions may change, but the worth of a vehicle goes far beyond the vehicle itself."
Event_XZPLW_24_7,"Even if someday bikes disappear from the streets, the culture they embody will live on!"
Event_XZPLW_24_8,Namipon...
Event_XZPLW_24_9,Never seen you so worked up before.
Event_XZPLW_24_10,"Thank you, Namipon. Wait, you can talk?! So the mascot of Honami is real?"
Event_XZPLW_24_11,"Ahaha, it's a long story... Passenger, I'll take her to somewhere safe first."
Event_XZPLW_24_12,That's another castaway hunt wrapped up nicely.
Event_XZPLW_26_1,So the most common vehicles in Lahai-Roi are... motorcycles?
Event_XZPLW_26_2,"Sitting on a motorcycle, feeling the wind race past your ear, that sounds relaxing."
Event_XZPLW_27_1,"Super Detective Team, back in action! I cannot wait to hunt the truth with you."
Event_XZPLW_27_2,"Long time no see, detective."
Event_XZPLW_27_3,I figured you'd show up.
Event_XZPLW_27_4,"This time, the castaway awaits in the Honami Central Park. It's the kind of item that brings nostalgia."
Event_XZPLW_27_5,"Enough chatter. Come on, let's go!"
Event_XZPLW_28_1,Hmm... No luck spotting it myself. I'll leave this challenge to you!
Event_XZPLW_28_2,"Every speck, every mark, scrutinize them all. The smallest clue could be the missing piece of the puzzle."
Event_XZPLW_29_1,This is… a tent? Looks ordinary.
Event_XZPLW_29_2,Haha! Real detectives aren't like those in novels and comics. Big cases don't fall into our laps at every street corner.
Event_XZPLW_29_3,"Most days, it's just humble work, like tracking runaway cats, shadowing cheating—Ahem..."
Event_XZPLW_29_4,"Anyway, the tent, yes. That reminds me of a bizarre case I solved years ago. Care for a tale?"
Event_XZPLW_29_5,"Yes, please."
Event_XZPLW_29_6,"Even if I say no, you'll just keep going, won't you?"
Event_XZPLW_29_7,"It was a summer's day. A middle-aged sculptor—let's call him ""A""—was found dead in his camping tent."
Event_XZPLW_29_8,"Time of death, dawn. Cause, a dagger through the back. And at the scene stood a plaster statue."
Event_XZPLW_29_9,"It seemed ""A"" was working on a new sculpture when the killer struck from behind."
Event_XZPLW_29_10,"But here comes the curious part. The ground was muddy from the rain the night before, but there was not a single footprint around the tent."
Event_XZPLW_29_11,"Which means... no one in, no one out. That tent was a classic ""locked room""!"
Event_XZPLW_29_12,Did you just make that up?
Event_XZPLW_29_13,The story's a bit worn out…
Event_XZPLW_29_14,"Ahem. Want to try your hand at deduction? To be clear, this case involves no Resonator tricks."
Event_XZPLW_29_15,(This was clearly suicide.)
Event_XZPLW_29_16,(This was clearly a statue trick.)
Event_XZPLW_29_17,I'm not in the mood for riddles.
Event_XZPLW_29_18,"It was ice. ""A"" froze the dagger's hilt in a block of ice, blade pointing upward."
Event_XZPLW_29_19,"Then he leaned back onto it, stabbing himself. The ice melted in the summer heat, erasing the evidence and making it seem like a murder."
Event_XZPLW_29_20,Brilliant! You noticed the temperature and drew a solid answer!
Event_XZPLW_29_21,"It was the statue. The killer disguised themselves as a plaster statue, then stabbed ""A"" when his guard was down."
Event_XZPLW_29_22,"And when others arrived, the killer kept pretending to be a plaster statue, right at the scene."
Event_XZPLW_29_23,Excellent! You focused on the key object and drew a solid answer!
Event_XZPLW_29_24,"Hmm, I was hoping you'd dazzle me with your own theory."
Event_XZPLW_29_25,"Alright then, just tell me the truth."
Event_XZPLW_29_26,Very well! The truth is that the killer sent a Chop Chop Echo inside the tent to do the dirty work!
Event_XZPLW_29_27,...Totally believable.
Event_XZPLW_29_28,Chisa would hate this kind of deduction.
Event_XZPLW_29_29,"Ahem. Now then, time to unveil the Lahai-Roi secrets in this castaway!"
Event_XZPLW_3_1,(This does look like something you'd find in Honami.)
Event_XZPLW_3_2,(Looks like a note is attached to it.)
Event_XZPLW_31_1,The design of these living facilities is really unique...
Event_XZPLW_31_2,Am I seeing straight? Why are their tents shaped like sheep?
Event_XZPLW_32_1,The Namipon in charge of this search... is not here?
Event_XZPLW_33_1,"To lighten her master's troubles is the basic duty of a maid.
If you are reading this note, it means—
I have already set out to retrieve the castaway for you!

This time, the castaway should be near the Meishin Passageway.
There shouldn't be any danger… I hope."
Event_XZPLW_34_1,"As long as I carry my master's mission, I will not give in!"
Event_XZPLW_34_2,Oh no… I can't... I'm terrible at combat...
Event_XZPLW_35_1,Goshujin-sama! Thank you for saving me in time. I found this castaway further inside the passageway.
Event_XZPLW_35_2,"For some reason, the castaway seems to have drawn the TDs here."
Event_XZPLW_35_3,You need to stay safe.
Event_XZPLW_35_4,Don't go off to risky places by yourself again.
Event_XZPLW_35_5,"Understood. Next time, I will not disgrace myself like this."
Event_XZPLW_35_6,"Please, allow me to show you the castaway's original form!"
Event_XZPLW_37_1,It turns out to be a mechanical bird that wakes people in the morning.
Event_XZPLW_37_2,"Hehe, Goshujin-sama, I'm sure you'd prefer a maid's voice waking you up instead, right?"
Event_XZPLW_38_1,"Passenger, welcome back. Finally, our castaway search is almost finished."
Event_XZPLW_38_2,Almost finished?
Event_XZPLW_38_3,You're finally back to your usual self.
Event_XZPLW_38_4,Yes. These past days must have been tiring for you.
Event_XZPLW_38_5,Because it's the one you know best.
Event_XZPLW_38_6,"Thanks to the castaways we've collected, I can soon pin down the coordinates from Honami to Lahai-Roi."
Event_XZPLW_38_7,"Once the rift stabilizes, you and Chisa will be able to return to your Academy."
Event_XZPLW_38_8,"You've been a huge help, Namipon."
Event_XZPLW_38_9,But… there's still one last castaway to be found.
Event_XZPLW_38_10,"Hehe, and it's really close by. It's up on the coffeehouse terrace."
Event_XZPLW_38_11,"Go check it out, Passenger."
Event_XZPLW_39_1,"Morning, {PlayerName}. Hope I didn't surprise you much."
Event_XZPLW_39_2,"Good to see you again, Chisa."
Event_XZPLW_39_3,…I should've guessed.
Event_XZPLW_39_4,Namipon said the last castaway was up here on the terrace.
Event_XZPLW_39_5,"Well, I'm sort of a ""castaway"" from <te href=260004>Lahai-Roi</te> myself."
Event_XZPLW_39_6,"Haha, sorry. I was making weird jokes again. Anyway, here it is. I found it near Neon Tower."
Event_XZPLW_39_7,"The search went smoothly. The only challenge was not knowing the exact location, but a sweet schoolgirl showed me the way."
Event_XZPLW_39_8,A sweet... schoolgirl?
Event_XZPLW_39_9,"Right. She was into robot culture, and before she left, she told me—"
Event_XZPLW_39_10,"""In times like this, even a schoolgirl can pilot a robot!"""
Event_XZPLW_39_11,...
Event_XZPLW_39_12,Is that some new catchphrase?
Event_XZPLW_39_13,"It's nice, isn't it? Even as the loop ends, some of the Left Behind remain here in Honami, living their quiet, everyday lives."
Event_XZPLW_39_14,"You must have pieced together something about Lahai-Roi from the castaways, right?"
Event_XZPLW_39_15,I can't help much… I didn't stay at Startorch Academy long enough to gather much info.
Event_XZPLW_39_16,That means we're on the same starting line. We'll learn about Lahai-Roi together once we get there.
Event_XZPLW_39_17,Hm. I'd love to.
Event_XZPLW_39_18,"I have a feeling… Once you're back at the Academy, you'll be pulled into many things."
Event_XZPLW_39_19,What sort of things?
Event_XZPLW_39_20,Is there something you know?
Event_XZPLW_39_21,I honestly don't know. But it should have a lot to do with your time there.
Event_XZPLW_39_22,"Sooner or later, we'll run into our own share of troubles. But whatever happens, I believe everything will turn out all right."
Event_XZPLW_39_23,"We'll help each other out, classmate."
Event_XZPLW_39_24,"Yes, we will help each other. As classmates."
Event_XZPLW_39_25,"Ahem, back to the business. Let's take a look at what's inside this castaway."
Event_XZPLW_4_1,"When... did the rain stop?
...Even if no rain falls, I will stay here with you."
Event_XZPLW_41_1,"…On my way to academic enrollment, I saw this towering figure standing at the horizon of the frostlands."
Event_XZPLW_41_2,"Later, I found its name in the Academy orientation materials—"
Event_XZPLW_41_3,Exostrider.
Event_XZPLW_41_4,"From what I read, it's directly tied to why Startorch Academy was founded in Lahai-Roi."
Event_XZPLW_42_1,"Some time later, you arrive near the Meishin Passageway mentioned in the note…"
Event_XZPLW_5_1,"Back so soon, Passenger! Seems everything went well."
Event_XZPLW_5_2,(Deliver the castaway.)
Event_XZPLW_5_3,"Ah, a sunny doll that carries people's wishes."
Event_XZPLW_5_4,"When the rainy season comes, Honami folk hang these dolls by their windows, hoping for fair weather."
Event_XZPLW_5_5,"Alright, time to find out what Lahai-Roi intel it holds..."
Event_XZPLW_7_1,"So, this is the sun Lahai-Roi's people have been living under."
Event_XZPLW_7_2,If that's the case… does it still rain there at all?
Event_XZPLW_8_1,"Passenger, you're here! I'll be guiding you to the castaway today."
Event_XZPLW_8_2,"It's you, the mall guide."
Event_XZPLW_8_3,Why is it you this time?
Event_XZPLW_8_4,"This time, the castaway is not at the Crossing. It's over by the shops on Ginga Street."
Event_XZPLW_8_5,And I know Ginga Street inside out. So they sent me to guide you.
Event_XZPLW_8_6,Time to set off.
Event_XZPLW_8_7,That's a bit of a trek.
Event_XZPLW_8_8,"Hold on, Passenger. I can teleport you there directly."
Event_XZPLW_8_9,"Destination: Ginga Street! In three, two, one... off we go!"
Event_XZPLW_9_1,This bento... I saw it first.
Event_XZPLW_9_2,"Hah! ""First come, first served""? Don't insult me with playground rules. Remember, Stardust—"
Event_XZPLW_9_3,"When night falls, this street becomes a battlefield. And the half-priced bento is the crown of a true King!"
Event_XZPLW_9_4,"If you lack the resolve to burn your soul for glory, then pay full price like the loser you are!"
Event_XZPLW_9_5,"I get it now. But with my companions' bonds on my shoulders, I will not lose."
Event_XZPLW_9_6,Then let me show you what a true King's duel is.
Event_XZPLW_9_7,...
Event_XZPLW_9_8,It's just a bento...
Event_XZPLW_9_9,Hold it. Seems our duel has attracted a spectator.
Event_XZPLW_9_10,"You there, stranger, tell us. Who deserves this half-priced bento?"
Event_XZPLW_9_11,"Stardust, obviously."
Event_XZPLW_9_12,"The King, no doubt."
Event_XZPLW_9_13,"Actually, I'm an Apex Duelist of Peak of Prestige."
Event_XZPLW_9_14,Hah! Then you clearly know nothing of the gulf between me and him!
Event_XZPLW_9_15,Hahahaha! Good! For I am the King of Ginga Street.
Event_XZPLW_9_16,I see… so you're a duelist as well. But what is this Peak of Prestige?
Event_XZPLW_9_17,"Like that, you witness a mysterious evening duel on Ginga Street."
