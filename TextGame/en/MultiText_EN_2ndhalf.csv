MAIN_RGLC_1_1,(Luuk texted me to go over the Exostrider plan at the infirmary. Better get going.)
MAIN_RGLC_10_4,"The ""Golden Serum"" developed by the Novialle Group. But I prefer its other name—<te href=750042>Ichor</te>."
MAIN_RGLC_10_5,"My father started it as a medication for rare diseases. But as research progressed, it came to represent something far more ambitious—the ""drug of evolution."""
MAIN_RGLC_10_6,Evolution? Sounds like something the Fractsidus would like.
MAIN_RGLC_10_7,"Well, on paper, it worked. I became its Resonator, so it would be unfair to say it was entirely useless."
MAIN_RGLC_10_8,But I was a rare case who survived. All it cost me was excruciating pain and my color vision. Most test subjects like me didn't make it.
MAIN_RGLC_10_9,It wasn't until I met you that I realized there was more to the story.
MAIN_RGLC_10_10,"A vial of ""Golden Serum,"" an ""evolutionary drug"" developed by the Novialle Regenerative Group, owned by Luuk's adoptive father, which drew the Fractsidus's attention."
MAIN_RGLC_11_5,The entire Lollo Logistics carrier was already blown to smithereens by the time I recovered this page.
MAIN_RGLC_11_6,"I managed a quick glimpse before the fire consumed most of the page. Hehe, it is a report from an Overseer."
MAIN_RGLC_11_7,A Fractsidus Overseer's report on its way to the New Federation?
MAIN_RGLC_11_8,"Yes, tucked away in a Lollo Logistics delivery box."
MAIN_RGLC_11_9,"The recipient is ""Eris"" in the New Federation."
MAIN_RGLC_11_10,"A scorched report from a Fractsidus Overseer, meant to be sent to ""Eris"" in the New Federation."
MAIN_RGLC_12_4,My brother Rhein drew this picture.
MAIN_RGLC_12_5,We're not related by blood. Father took us both in after his own children passed away from a rare illness long ago.
MAIN_RGLC_12_6,"For a while, I tried to be the perfect son Father wanted. It never worked, so eventually I stopped trying."
MAIN_RGLC_12_7,It only got worse from there. What Father tried to do to Rhein was unforgivable. And then came that accident...
MAIN_RGLC_12_8,"I thought what my father did was a rather mundane story. A cliché, someone trying to atone for past guilt, only to cause greater harm."
MAIN_RGLC_12_9,Until your hints made me suspect it was someone's staged finale. So I had my father's grave exhumed. It was empty.
MAIN_RGLC_12_10,"Rhein never could handle pain, but he was easy to cheer up.  Whenever the grown-ups would give me candy, I'd save it all for him."
MAIN_RGLC_12_11,(So that's why he always has candy with him.)
MAIN_RGLC_12_12,"A child's drawing inside a picture frame. A family portrait drawn by Luuk's younger brother, Rhein."
MAIN_RGLC_12161_1,"A niche edition of ""The Minimalist Approach to Cat Psychology,"" a magazine that the infirmary has a subscription to."
MAIN_RGLC_12161_2,"The subscriber doesn't own a cat. Rumor says he's not even good with them. Others have seen him late at night, holding a copy and staring into space."
MAIN_RGLC_12161_3,"It was Rhein, Luuk Herssen's younger brother, who loved this magazine series. The good doctor took over the subscription after him and, even years after leaving home, has never canceled it."
MAIN_RGLC_12162_1,"Luuk Herssen gathered this dirt from the ""place where he rests."""
MAIN_RGLC_12162_2,"Few know of its significance, yet Luuk places it in the sunlight every day. No one knows why he studies and measures this frozen mound of dirt that never thaws."
MAIN_RGLC_13_1,"Those three items you just showed me... Did the Fractsidus get into <te href=750043>Novialle's</te> work after learning about the <te href=750042>Ichor's</te> potential for ""evolution""?"
MAIN_RGLC_13_2,"They didn't just ""get into"" our work. They went a step further—replacement."
MAIN_RGLC_13_3,Have you ever met the Fractsidus's Grand Architect?
MAIN_RGLC_13_4,"The ""thousand-faced survivor."" We met near the ""Styx Lake"" deep within the Dark Tide."
MAIN_RGLC_13_5,Wait... Does this mean your father was...?
MAIN_RGLC_13_6,"Yes. My father was just another face the Grand Architect borrowed. Though, looking back now, I can't recall the moment the real him was taken."
MAIN_RGLC_13_7,"I think the Grand Architect sees life and death as a game. I wouldn't be surprised if ""Father"" was even smiling in his coffin as we buried him in that downpour!"
MAIN_RGLC_13_8,"So, that's your answer. Why did you choose me? Because I have a very personal reason to go after the Fractsidus—hatred."
MAIN_RGLC_13_9,Hatred... Even now?
MAIN_RGLC_13_10,"Now, it has become something of a habit."
MAIN_RGLC_13_11,"Continue this train of investigation and you'll see for yourself what they are. But before you do, there's something I should share."
MAIN_RGLC_13_12,My friends in the Black Shores told me you've already had a few run-ins with certain Overseers. Is that right?
MAIN_RGLC_13_13,"Three: Cristoforo, Phrolova, and Scar. Plus the Grand Architect you mentioned."
MAIN_RGLC_13_14,"Ah, those names do ring a bell. Phrolova is codenamed Hecate. Cristoforo? Arachnos. Intriguing, isn't it? The flair they have for their own branding."
MAIN_RGLC_13_15,"But it's a telling detail. A codename can reveal its owner's style, personal tastes, and even ambitions."
MAIN_RGLC_13_16,"Think about it. A powerful Resonator who causes chaos at random leaves no trail to follow. But give them a preference, a pattern, and we can start to build a profile from the pieces."
MAIN_RGLC_13_17,I've been compiling reports on the Overseers for years. Allow me to share what I've learned so far.
MAIN_RGLC_13_18,"Luuk explains that his father's identity was also stolen by the Fractsidus's Grand Architect. Hatred was his initial motivation for pursuing the organization, and the very reason your past self chose him for this task."
MAIN_RGLC_14_1,I've reactivated your access. You'll find the door controls right over there.
MAIN_RGLC_15_1,"The Fractsidus is loosely organized. Most of its members have only undergone basic, artificially-induced body modification. They're not terribly difficult to neutralize."
MAIN_RGLC_15_2,"But if you encounter Artificers with more... creative modifications,  you're likely looking at the handiwork of ""Hydra."""
MAIN_RGLC_15_3,"Hydra is their leading mind on human evolution and body modifications. Whoever they are, they often work in tandem with ""Siren."""
MAIN_RGLC_15_4,"In other words, if you spot one, be on guard in case the other is lurking close by."
MAIN_RGLC_15_5,"Zashiki-warashi won't require much of your attention. This Overseer primarily operates in Ashinohara, a region that's been largely destroyed by the Lament."
MAIN_RGLC_15_6,Ashinohara... I've heard of it somewhere before.
MAIN_RGLC_15_7,"The girl we had in the infirmary for a while, Chisa, I remember? The city that trapped her, Honami, is part of Ashinohara."
MAIN_RGLC_15_9,"Now, on to two key pieces of the puzzle."
MAIN_RGLC_15_10,"I did say the Fractsidus was a loose organization, but even the most scattered cells still need funding to function."
MAIN_RGLC_15_11,Remember that report from earlier? It's only a matter of time before you go to the New Federation. And based on the intel I've gathered...
MAIN_RGLC_15_12,"That's their most critical base of operations, and where you'll find ""Eris."""
MAIN_RGLC_15_13,How critical? Do they operate in the open?
MAIN_RGLC_15_14,"Not exactly. But in a place where money talks, they must have members in the highest echelons of government and business. Key members."
MAIN_RGLC_15_15,"Their foothold in the New Federation has given them immense leverage. With that endless stream of wealth, the Fractsidus operates with impunity across the planet."
MAIN_RGLC_15_16,"Speaking of which, Startorch Academy is also heavily funded by the New Federation. To be blunt, they're the Spacetrek Collective's single largest donor."
MAIN_RGLC_15_17,"Eris, huh? Duly noted. I'm assuming the other key piece is the Grand Architect?"
MAIN_RGLC_15_18,"The Fractsidus Grand Architect. Their true name is unknown. They only appear through borrowed identities: Real people, legendary beings, and even the phantoms of the dead from others' memories."
MAIN_RGLC_15_19,I did brush shoulders with them once. It was a shame I had no idea at the time and missed my shot.
MAIN_RGLC_15_20,This pen was the only thing I brought back from that great fire.
MAIN_RGLC_15_21,"I have yet to discipher the lettering, but it shows one thing for sure: the Grand Architect has been around for a very, very long time."
MAIN_RGLC_15_22,"It's a pity you called me to Lahai-Roi. Otherwise, I would've continued following that trail. But you always have good reason. Right?"
MAIN_RGLC_15_23,You uncovered all this by yourself?
MAIN_RGLC_15_24,More or less. I did have some help along the way.
MAIN_RGLC_15_25,To get your hands on one of the Grand Architect's personal items. You did more than just follow a trail. You infiltrated them.
MAIN_RGLC_15_26,"Playing along with them isn't that difficult once you get the hang of it. Like I said, they are a loose organization."
MAIN_RGLC_15_27,"Knowing the Fractsidus, stealing all that intel on the Overseers is risky, no matter how loose they are. Each infiltration will only be more dangerous than the last."
MAIN_RGLC_15_28,"Luuk, how can a doctor who doesn't value his own life save anyone else's?"
MAIN_RGLC_15_29,"You know, this is the second time you've said those words to me."
MAIN_RGLC_15_30,They got away again.
MAIN_RGLC_15_31,"(If I hadn't been so cautious, I could've ""taken care"" of them this time.)"
MAIN_RGLC_15_32,(I should send today's findings to {PlayerName}. It's been two years. I suppose I'm due for a report.)
MAIN_RGLC_15_33,"Good, you got the intel. Would've been a shame if I got myself killed for nothing."
MAIN_RGLC_15_34,You want me to go to Lahai-Roi? Why?
MAIN_RGLC_15_35,"There's evidence of their activity in Lahai-Roi. I need you to keep an eye on things. And frankly, you need a break."
MAIN_RGLC_15_36,Now is not the right time.
MAIN_RGLC_15_37,"You've already drawn enough attention. Do we really have to wait for you to get killed to decide it's ""the right time""?"
MAIN_RGLC_15_38,How can a doctor save anyone else's life if he doesn't value his own?  Keep pushing like this and you'll be no different from them.
MAIN_RGLC_15_39,"Not pulling any punches, are you?"
MAIN_RGLC_15_40,"Trust me, that's only the warm up. Lahai-Roi is a nice place, Luuk. Bright, passionate students, beautiful snow. Perfect for slowing things down."
MAIN_RGLC_15_41,Listen to me on this. Come.
MAIN_RGLC_15_42,...
MAIN_RGLC_15_43,Very well. As you wish.
MAIN_RGLC_15_44,"So I've led a leisurely life in Lahai-Roi ever since. No need to worry, I know my limits."
MAIN_RGLC_15_45,"Let's set aside the Fractsidus for now. We should discuss the Exostrider plan. But first, tell me what happened to you and Aemeath in the frostlands."
MAIN_RGLC_15_46,(You briefly recount to Luuk the events in the frostlands.)
MAIN_RGLC_15_47,"I see. Aemeath, she... No wonder you're in such a state."
MAIN_RGLC_15_48,"I understand her reasons. She was fighting for her dream, for Lahai-Roi, in the only way she knew how. And I respect that. The fate she chose for herself."
MAIN_RGLC_15_49,But I won't accept it. There's more I haven't tried. I'm not done fighting for her.
MAIN_RGLC_15_50,Of course. I wouldn't expect you to give up so easily.
MAIN_RGLC_15_51,"Now, about the Exostrider... It started with the Spacetrek Collective finding a ""giant Soliskin root network"" in Bjartr Woods. They identified it as the ""lid"" sealing the Stridergate, so to speak."
MAIN_RGLC_15_52,"It keeps the Threnodian's fractured forms sealed on both sides of the Stridergate. Break it, and these forms will reunite. That wouldn't just spell Lahai-Roi's doomsday, but the entire word."
MAIN_RGLC_15_53,"But the Collective still yearned to open that gateway, to explore the unknown. So, they created the Synchronists. The idea was to use Augmented Resonance to amplify the Exostrider's power, hoping that would keep the Threnodian suppressed."
MAIN_RGLC_15_54,"But lately, the Threnodian's attacks on the seal have been increasing. I'm afraid the Fractsidus is also getting ready to make a move."
MAIN_RGLC_15_55,"With the Reactor Core returned, all you need now is a little patience. Wait for the Exostrider to awaken. Then we can focus on how to use it to find Aemeath."
MAIN_RGLC_15_56,You were a Synchronist in the Academy once before. I'll speak with Lucilla about getting you piloting access.
MAIN_RGLC_15_57,"Then I'll wait for your news, Luuk."
MAIN_RGLC_15_58,Certainly. But our immediate priority should be the Fractsidus. I have a feeling they're planning to sabotage our plans for the Exostrider.
MAIN_RGLC_15_59,"In a secret workspace, Luuk introduces you to the wealth of intelligence he gathered while infiltrating the Fractsidus. His apparent indifference to his own life or death raises your suspicion. He promises to speak with Lucilla to smoothly advance your plans with the Exostrider, which entails you piloting it beyond the Stridergate to retrieve Aemeath.
In the past, Luuk once teetered on the edge of darkness, holding the Grand Architect's pen amidst burning flames. Your past self called him to Lahai-Roi, preventing his fall and ensuring he did not become the very enemy he hunted."
MAIN_RGLC_2_1,(Nivora... Has she been staying here to recover?)
MAIN_RGLC_28_1,Ha... haha...
MAIN_RGLC_28_2,I-I brought the student! Just like you asked! You... Where are you?!
MAIN_RGLC_28_3,"Lahai-Roi was just a minor setback! I'm still useful! I still have work in the New Federation, I still—"
MAIN_RGLC_28_4,Stop hiding! Say something!
MAIN_RGLC_28_5,ARGH! YOU! That doctor who's always watching.
MAIN_RGLC_28_6,"You've reached a dead end, Warren. Don't you see that?"
MAIN_RGLC_28_7,Hehehe... AHAHAHAHA!
MAIN_RGLC_28_8,It's your dead end!
MAIN_RGLC_28_9,"Nivora lies unconscious on the ground. Warren, desperate and on the brink of madness, lunges at Luuk."
MAIN_RGLC_29_1,(SkyArk's data room. There must be a reason.)
MAIN_RGLC_29_2,(Was that just impulse... or perhaps...)
MAIN_RGLC_3_1,"How are you recovering from your injuries, Nivora?"
MAIN_RGLC_3_2,"Oh, i-it's you, {PlayerName}. Uh, yes. I'm feeling much better."
MAIN_RGLC_3_3,"Dr. Herssen took very good care of me. I just did what he said and rested for a few days here, and I barely feel any pain now."
MAIN_RGLC_3_4,Are you here to visit him?
MAIN_RGLC_3_5,"Yes, we have something to discuss. Is he here?"
MAIN_RGLC_3_6,He's in the counseling room next door. Um... My friend Sigrika is in there. It might take a while.
MAIN_RGLC_3_7,Thanks. Take care of yourself.
MAIN_RGLC_30_1,No!
MAIN_RGLC_30_2,"Oh... Dr. Herssen... Warren, is he—"
MAIN_RGLC_30_3,"He's only unconscious. Everything's okay, Nivora. How are you feeling?"
MAIN_RGLC_30_4,Ugh... I'm... fine. It's just that he struck me in the back of the neck. It really hurts.
MAIN_RGLC_30_5,I'm... really scared.
MAIN_RGLC_30_6,"It's okay. Don't force yourself to hold it in. After a shock like that, it's much better if you let it out. Keeping it bottled up is stressful in itself."
MAIN_RGLC_30_7,Take your time. Tell me what happened when you're ready.
MAIN_RGLC_30_8,Okay... I'll try... I just... I need a moment...
MAIN_RGLC_30_9,Then rest here for now. I'll go check on Warren.
MAIN_RGLC_30_10,"I fell asleep on the hospital bed. When I woke up and opened my eyes, Warren was pointing a gun at my head."
MAIN_RGLC_30_11,"He was frantic. Grilled me non-stop about SkyArk. And when he found out I'd been to the station before, he forced me to bring him."
MAIN_RGLC_30_12,Wait! Those researchers by the door—
MAIN_RGLC_30_13,One of them didn't make it. The other two are still alive.
MAIN_RGLC_30_14,"I see. As for what else happened, I don't really remember."
MAIN_RGLC_30_15,"That's alright. I've already formed a rough theory about his motives now. You should rest, Nivora. We'll handle things from here."
MAIN_RGLC_30_16,"Is that so? Then, Dr. Herssen, care to share your theory?"
MAIN_RGLC_30_17,"After rescuing the unconscious Nivora, she claims Warren coerced her into guiding him to the station. Luuk comforts the shaken girl and begins checking Warren's condition.
Nivora trembles as she stands, then begins to approach Luuk from behind."
MAIN_RGLC_32_1,"My, my. Played me for a fool, didn't you?"
MAIN_RGLC_32_2,I was going to kill you for a little one-on-one time with {PlayerName}. Shame.
MAIN_RGLC_32_3,"Regrettable, that you evaded what was meant for you."
MAIN_RGLC_32_4,But it's okay. Uncle Warren's dead. Nice and clean!
MAIN_RGLC_32_5,"Being caught out in the open, and still he thought he could just vanish from Lahai-Roi and get away with this fiasco? The naivety is remarkable."
MAIN_RGLC_32_6,"Anyway, I got back what I wanted too, so I'm a happy girl."
MAIN_RGLC_32_7,"On my way here, I kept wondering why you acted so quickly. It didn't fit your usual style of staying in character until the very end."
MAIN_RGLC_32_8,Just as I thought... You were after this pen.
MAIN_RGLC_32_9,"Ah, yes. My precious. I couldn't find it anywhere! So it was you who took it from me."
MAIN_RGLC_32_10,"This is the first time someone's taken something from me! Oh, I almost forgot to ask, when did you begin to suspect?"
MAIN_RGLC_32_11,"If you must know, my suspicions began to deepen during our last visit to the space station. When you feigned that injury."
MAIN_RGLC_32_13,"Your ""acting"" had been flawless, Grand Architect. But even you cannot mimic what you don't understand."
MAIN_RGLC_32_14,Death itself.
MAIN_RGLC_32_15,"To an immortal like you, no matter how many times you die, it's just another lost identity. And I happened to have ""seen"" <ano=my father>you</ano> die before."
MAIN_RGLC_32_16,Oh? Is this why you've had your eye on me all this time?
MAIN_RGLC_32_17,"Let me think... Hmm, whoops? Can't seem to remember. My bad."
MAIN_RGLC_32_18,"My real favorite things are the ones that are really old and far, far away."
MAIN_RGLC_32_19,"But you... you're something special, Dr. Herssen! You're the first person in forever to ever come this close."
MAIN_RGLC_32_20,"Without you, the game in Lahai-Roi would be so boring! So, you get prizes!"
MAIN_RGLC_32_21,"And I promise, it's right up your alley."
MAIN_RGLC_32_22,"Now, for the first one. At the upcoming New Solar Celebration, among all the lovely students, stands a member of the Fractsidus."
MAIN_RGLC_32_23,I'm so looking forward to that child's performance!
MAIN_RGLC_32_24,Telling us this doesn't do your spy any good.
MAIN_RGLC_32_25,"But that's what makes it fun! It's a cat-and-mouse game. The mouse needs to know the cat is coming, or how else will it run fast enough on its little wheel?"
MAIN_RGLC_32_26,"To win, you just have to be the hunter."
MAIN_RGLC_32_27,"And if you do end up catching that child, that just proves they were useless anyway!"
MAIN_RGLC_32_28,That was only the first. What's the next one?
MAIN_RGLC_32_29,"The next prize is right here in this data room. You're so smart, Dr. Herssen. I bet you've already figured it out, no?"
MAIN_RGLC_32_30,"Let's be sure to have more fun like this in the future. Until next time, you two!"
MAIN_RGLC_32_31,"I wish you a pleasant past, present, and future!"
MAIN_RGLC_32_32,"I had so much fun on this little trip to the SkyArk. So, {PlayerName}, how did you feel seeing the Etheric Sea?"
MAIN_RGLC_32_33,"Oh, home, sweet home! Your faraway home, the one you can never, ever go back to!"
MAIN_RGLC_32_34,...!
MAIN_RGLC_32_35,Mmm! Leading you there wasn't all for nothing. The look on your face was the sweetest treat.
MAIN_RGLC_32_36,"Nivora, the Grand Architect of the Fractsidus in disguise, openly confesses ""she"" revealed herself early to reclaim an old pen. In a mocking acknowledgment of Luuk's efforts, ""she"" casually informs you that another Fractsidus member hides among the students during the upcoming New Solar Celebration, and that what Luuk seeks is in the station's data room.
This entire SkyArk incident was ""her"" setup, and she hints at knowing the truth of your origin. In the next moment, ""she"" vanishes."
MAIN_RGLC_33_1,Why did you stop me? You think we couldn't have stopped her here?
MAIN_RGLC_33_2,"Yes. My goal was to gather intelligence, not apprehend the Fractsidus's Grand Architect."
MAIN_RGLC_33_3,"The Grand Architect may appear to act on a whim, but in my observation, that playfulness is just another layer of disguise. There's a purpose behind it."
MAIN_RGLC_33_4,"When N.A.N.A. called earlier, something felt off. Warren is a researcher himself. Why would he need to take a student hostage to investigate a debris field?"
MAIN_RGLC_33_5,"Even if he did, breaking into the infirmary and letting N.A.N.A. send a distress call was a sloppy strategy. Of course, I'd be the first person she contacted."
MAIN_RGLC_33_6,"I did hear Nivora say you've had her in the infirmary all this time. You were keeping an eye on her, then?"
MAIN_RGLC_33_7,"I was waiting for her to show her hand. Until then, it was all speculation. I needed to see her end the ""act"" to be sure."
MAIN_RGLC_33_8,Immortal. A thousand faces... We've managed to gather quite a bit of intel on the Grand Architect.
MAIN_RGLC_33_9,"If I'm not mistaken, there should be something more important hidden in this room."
MAIN_RGLC_33_10,"Otherwise, she wouldn't have called it a prize."
MAIN_RGLC_33_11,"When we dug up my ""father's"" empty grave, I realized that it is no simple feat to find an immortal who leaves no trail."
MAIN_RGLC_33_12,So that's why you called me afterwards.
MAIN_RGLC_33_13,"Luuk's contact with you on his way to the space station made this joint strike against the Grand Architect possible. For now, he believes you lack the means to truly eliminate this ""thousand-faced individual,"" and that gathering more intelligence is the current priority."
MAIN_RGLC_34_1,These are... the personnel files from the SkyArk Space Station.
MAIN_RGLC_34_2,This lettering—
MAIN_RGLC_34_3,"Do you recall the lead researcher on the Etheric Sea Initiative, {PlayerName}? The one we saw in the hologram during our first visit."
MAIN_RGLC_34_4,Professor Junxi?
MAIN_RGLC_34_5,"Yes. During his lecture, he mentioned a scholar who had just joined the project, Weiying. But his introduction was cut short."
MAIN_RGLC_34_6,I've found that scholar's record in the system. And her name.
MAIN_RGLC_34_7,The letters of this name are a perfect match with those engraved on that pen.
MAIN_RGLC_34_8,Are you saying that scholar is the Grand Architect?
MAIN_RGLC_34_9,"According to these records, the Etheric Sea Initiative was stalled due to a lack of funding until she joined. Then it was pushed back on track."
MAIN_RGLC_34_10,Her involvement influenced the <ano=Court of Savantae>CSC's</ano> decision on this project.
MAIN_RGLC_34_11,"But everything else about her birthplace, employment history, or academic background is missing."
MAIN_RGLC_34_18,Sounds like another identity borrowed by the Grand Architect.
MAIN_RGLC_34_19,Indeed. It seems we've just traced this thousand-faced individual back to an even earlier point in Solaris's history.
MAIN_RGLC_34_20,These records also show Weiying took great interest in the CSC and Etheric Sea Initiative during that period. That must be why she infiltrated the SkyArk Space Station.
MAIN_RGLC_34_21,"The universe… What secrets is it hiding, behind all those infinite stars?"
MAIN_RGLC_34_22,I really want to know.
MAIN_RGLC_34_23,"And about that footage—No, no need to explain. The fewer people who know about your secret, the better."
MAIN_RGLC_34_24,"It just occurred to me that this wasn't a coincidence. If her goal in the past involved you, then it's something to keep in mind on your journey ahead."
MAIN_RGLC_34_25,(The Etheric Sea. That might've been my entry point to Solaris after leaving my distant homeland.)
MAIN_RGLC_34_26,(Weiying was interested in the Etheric Sea before its planet-wide spread. Did she want to use it as a medium to reach somewhere beyond?)
MAIN_RGLC_34_27,"I will. Given her nature, it's only a matter of time before we meet again."
MAIN_RGLC_34_28,"The more she appears, the more she gives away. If she enjoys ""playing games,"" then it means she'll follow some rules at least."
MAIN_RGLC_34_29,"Otherwise, she'd die of boredom."
MAIN_RGLC_34_30,"Hah, exactly. And as I've said before, sometimes style, personal taste, and ambition can be more revealing than intended."
MAIN_RGLC_34_31,"The Fractsidus has more than one base in Solaris, and I'm far from the only one with a grudge or an interest in their activities. Until now, the Grand Architect has been like a reflection in water. ""She"" never appears as her own person, only by the faces of the already dead."
MAIN_RGLC_34_32,"But now, her fascination with what lies ""beyond all those infinite stars"" is a thread we can pull. We can start identifying which schemes bear her signature."
MAIN_RGLC_34_33,"I'll be cautious. Before Nivora, did you find any other traces of this Grand Architect in Lahai-Roi?"
MAIN_RGLC_34_34,Yes. There is this one thing. But it's only speculation.
MAIN_RGLC_34_35,"About how Aemeath disappeared, from what you told me, she died from Overclocking trying to stop the Threnodian over a decade ago."
MAIN_RGLC_34_36,"After that incident, the Academy detected cracks on the Threnodian seal in the depths of Bjartr Woods. The damage seemed... intentional."
MAIN_RGLC_34_37,You mean...
MAIN_RGLC_34_38,I believe it was the Grand Architect who damaged the seal. And that led to Aemeath's death.
MAIN_RGLC_34_39,...
MAIN_RGLC_34_40,"Lucilla's people will handle things here now. We should leave, {PlayerName}."
MAIN_RGLC_34_41,To where?
MAIN_RGLC_34_42,Let's go clear our minds. You shouldn't sit with this alone.
MAIN_RGLC_34_43,"And the Court of Savantae... since our Grand Architect has taken interest in them before, a trip to Mengzhou may be worth a visit."
MAIN_RGLC_34_44,The Court of Savantae was active in Mengzhou?
MAIN_RGLC_34_45,Just a rumor. They say a city was built there under their direction. There may be clues there.
MAIN_RGLC_34_46,"As for the New Federation, you'll likely end up there eventually if you plan to counter the Fractsidus's operations in the future."
MAIN_RGLC_34_47,"But not now. Things are too complicated over there, and they handle Resonators differently. Even with the Black Shores' backing, going in unprepared would be serious risk."
MAIN_RGLC_34_48,"Inside the data room, you learn the Grand Architect once worked at the SkyArk Station, promoting the Court of Savantae's research on the Etheric Sea—she showed intense interest in it. Connecting the Etheric Sea's link to you and its potential as a gateway, you begin to form theories.
Then Luuk reveals his suspicion that the Grand Architect was the one who sabotaged the Stridergate seal, triggering the Threnodian's breach. To save Lahai-Roi, Aemeath Overclocked forcing a resonance with the Exostrider to stop it. Fresh, burning fury consumes you. Seeing this, Luuk sighs and quietly invites you outside to walk."
MAIN_RGLC_35_1,Penny for your thoughts?
MAIN_RGLC_35_2,There's too many to count.
MAIN_RGLC_35_3,Feel like talking about it?
MAIN_RGLC_35_4,Maybe a little.
MAIN_RGLC_36_1,I keep wondering if the choices I made in the past were the right ones.
MAIN_RGLC_36_2,I still don't know why I chose to erase my memories. That one decision cost me my grip on everything. It made me leave so many people behind.
MAIN_RGLC_36_3,"You, Aemeath, those at the Black Shores, and probably more I don't even know or remember now."
MAIN_RGLC_36_4,"I pulled everyone into my grand plan to ""save the world,"" and when it mattered most, I wasn't even there."
MAIN_RGLC_36_5,"If we can't save Aemeath, she'll just be... forgotten. Left to drift in the void forever."
MAIN_RGLC_36_6,"Even if that hadn't happened, your path was always destined to diverge from most of ours."
MAIN_RGLC_36_7,"You know your lifespan is immense. Barring some accident, most of us will leave this world long before you."
MAIN_RGLC_36_8,"Death and goodbyes are a final lesson no one escapes. But for you, it's a question that lingers... for an exceptionally long time."
MAIN_RGLC_36_9,You're right.
MAIN_RGLC_36_10,"Since you already know that, you should also see that everyone else has already given their answer."
MAIN_RGLC_36_11,"You're still the same person you were before. Just as resilient. Still bringing hope to others. That's why, after all these years, we're still willing to stand with you."
MAIN_RGLC_36_12,And it's not because you're a supposed savior. It's because you've always been you.
MAIN_RGLC_36_13,And... we're not just doing this for you. We're doing it for Solaris. For the future we all chose to fight for.
MAIN_RGLC_36_14,We chose this path ourselves. You have nothing to feel guilty for.
MAIN_RGLC_36_15,One can only move forward by making peace with what's lost—You taught me that a long time ago.
MAIN_RGLC_36_16,In the end... I failed to find my father's murderer. I failed to protect Rhein... failed to protect my own family.
MAIN_RGLC_36_17,But your brother is still alive. You're alive. There's still hope. You did everything you could.
MAIN_RGLC_36_18,Who knows when... I'll wake up next time.
MAIN_RGLC_36_19,"Then we'll make a promise, Luuk."
MAIN_RGLC_36_20,"We'll see each other again next winter. You'll open your eyes, and I'll be standing right here, just like today."
MAIN_RGLC_36_24,"Luuk, my chances of saving Aemeath... They're pretty slim, aren't they?"
MAIN_RGLC_36_25,They are. You'll need a miracle. But you've always been good at making those happen.
MAIN_RGLC_36_26,Thanks for the candy.
MAIN_RGLC_36_27,You're very welcome.
MAIN_RGLC_36_28,"Come now. Enough with that face, {PlayerName}. Some candy?"
MAIN_RGLC_36_29,You always carry candy with you... You sure they really work?
MAIN_RGLC_36_30,As in?
MAIN_RGLC_36_31,"""It'll help take the edge off and lighten the mood."" Your words."
MAIN_RGLC_36_32,"Ah, that. Honestly, not really. It's become more of a habit of mine."
MAIN_RGLC_36_33,"As a boy, I'd have one whenever things felt too big to handle. The sweetness was a distraction, something to look forward to."
MAIN_RGLC_36_34,"Later, after I inherited <te href=750043>Novialle</te>, I realized there were still so many things I couldn't control. So I'd eat them to cope, especially when I was up to my neck in trouble thanks to my business associates."
MAIN_RGLC_36_35,"Even after I left the company and set out to follow the Fractsidus's trail on my own, I'd be chewing on one while I watched those who helped me die right in front of me. Still powerless, it seems."
MAIN_RGLC_36_36,"So I've come to believe that no matter how strong a person becomes, not everything can be done perfectly. In life, many things are beyond our control."
MAIN_RGLC_36_37,...
MAIN_RGLC_36_38,"But I still enjoy candy. It reminds me that meeting people is still a gift, even if I know I might lose them one day."
MAIN_RGLC_36_39,"If you let grief and anger burn you out, you become obsessed with results. You forget the joy you felt along the way."
MAIN_RGLC_36_40,A little sweetness helps keep the numbness at bay.
MAIN_RGLC_36_41,I'll have one of your candies.
MAIN_RGLC_36_42,How does it taste?
MAIN_RGLC_36_43,"Luuk Herssen talks about you, about candy, and about his own past. He says that no matter how strong you are, some things lie beyond anyone's control. But if you let sorrow and rage consume you, you'll lose even the memory of how it feels to be happy with someone again. As you walk with Luuk in the snow, you feel your resolve harden once more. You finally understand the kindness and solace held within a simple piece of candy.
This time, you accept the one he offers."
MAIN_RGLC_37_1,"({PlayerName} said {Male=he'd;Female=she'd} like to check on the Exostrider in the frostlands before {Male=he;Female=she} left. Well, it could be a way to take {Male=his;Female=her} mind off things.)"
MAIN_RGLC_37_2,Dr. Herssen. Is something the matter?
MAIN_RGLC_37_3,"Must you always assume the worst, Lucilla? Can't I just call to chat?"
MAIN_RGLC_37_4,"I find that highly unlikely, Doctor. Let's skip the preamble. What is it?"
MAIN_RGLC_37_5,{PlayerName}.
MAIN_RGLC_37_6,"Ah. So this is about ""Aemeath."" {Male=He;Female=She} was so tight-lipped with me about what happened in the frostlands, yet {Male=he;Female=she} spoke to you."
MAIN_RGLC_37_7,"Sitting on our hands won't fix anything, and {Male=he;Female=she} was willing to open up. If a friend runs into trouble, I'll naturally step in to listen."
MAIN_RGLC_37_8,"Besides, what I have to share today benefits the Academy. It could help us... get ahead of a few potential issues."
MAIN_RGLC_37_9,"Very well. Let's hear it then. Meet me at the Institute, the usual spot."
MAIN_RGLC_37_10,(Now then—)
MAIN_RGLC_37_11,"Luuk contacts Lucilla, and they arrange a meeting at the Research Institute."
MAIN_RGLC_38_1,Oh... Dr. Herssen... It's good to see you...
MAIN_RGLC_38_2,"Athan, you looked fine not long ago. What happened to you?"
MAIN_RGLC_38_3,M-My thesis... My spot at the...
MAIN_RGLC_38_4,"Hold on, I recall you coming by the infirmary with good news earlier. Something about an Institute professor recruiting you for your top marks?"
MAIN_RGLC_38_5,"Is this the price you have to pay for that? Careful, you might get talked out of the job over health issues."
MAIN_RGLC_38_6,No! I will get that position at the Institute! I'll crawl there if I have to! I'll... I'll come back from the dead if I die first!
MAIN_RGLC_38_7,"Sigh. Now you're just delirious. I know getting this opportunity wasn't easy, and you can't exactly just ask for time off. Come by my office later. I'll write you a sick note."
MAIN_RGLC_38_8,"You can't run yourself like an Exoswarm, thinking you'll recharge the moment the sun comes up. It's not how we humans work."
MAIN_RGLC_38_9,"Oh, thank you, Doctor! Good things are bound to come your way! Ah, this takes me back. I always got my best sleep passed out in your infirmary..."
MAIN_RGLC_39_1,"Ah, young Luuk! What brings you to the Institute today?"
MAIN_RGLC_39_2,Just here to discuss something with someone. How have your shifts been treating you these past few months?
MAIN_RGLC_39_3,"Not bad. You know these researchers, getting them in for a check-up is like pulling their teeth. I have to hunt them down myself."
MAIN_RGLC_39_4,"What do you say we grab a drink after my shift? The meal plans here are all ""nutritional efficiency."" Tastes like chewed-up cardboard!"
MAIN_RGLC_39_5,Of course. Why don't I show you that scout drone model I just finished while we're at it?
MAIN_RGLC_39_6,You work fast! You really do enjoy that sort of tinkering.
MAIN_RGLC_39_7,Taking things apart and putting them back together again is quite stress-relieving. It's a nice way to unwind after a day's work.
MAIN_RGLC_39_8,So... Whaddya say we sneak over to Rogan's place when we get a minute and... liberate the cannon barrel from that precious bot of his?
MAIN_RGLC_39_9,We can put it back after he's had a good meltdown!
MAIN_RGLC_39_10,Huh. I'd rather not be an accomplice to that. It's unethical. And I can't believe you're still holding a grudge over that fish he stewed behind your back.
MAIN_RGLC_4_1,"How to put this... I think you can have more faith in yourself, Sigrika."
MAIN_RGLC_4_2,Faith in myself...
MAIN_RGLC_4_3,"You see, people can be more perceptive than you might realize, including those you care about. So try not to take everything to heart. Go a little easier on yourself."
MAIN_RGLC_4_4,"Good or bad, true or false, these things have a way of coming to light. And as your friend Denia said, sometimes a little distraction is good for your health."
MAIN_RGLC_4_5,"Yeah… I'll give it a try! Thank you, Dr. Herssen."
MAIN_RGLC_4_6,"You're welcome. Again, don't push yourself too hard."
MAIN_RGLC_4_7,"I'd take it you're the type who'd suddenly bolt up in bed at night, wide awake, worrying about an exam. And that'd probably go on for a whole week."
MAIN_RGLC_4_8,Huh?! Is it really that obvious?!
MAIN_RGLC_4_9,Hahaha! Only my conjecture.
MAIN_RGLC_4_10,Would you like some candy? Sweets help keep a smile.
MAIN_RGLC_4_11,"Sure! And... is it okay for me to come back some other time, Dr. Herssen?"
MAIN_RGLC_4_12,"Why, of course. Feel free to visit my office any time, Sigrika."
MAIN_RGLC_4_13,"So, about that that Exostrider plan you mentioned. Let's get into it."
MAIN_RGLC_4_14,All in good time. Let's start with something lighter first.
MAIN_RGLC_4_15,Something lighter?
MAIN_RGLC_4_16,Any topic at all. But let's slow the tempo a little.
MAIN_RGLC_4_17,"You're too eager, {PlayerName}. Your emotions are clouding your judgment. You must feel it too."
MAIN_RGLC_4_18,Here. A piece of candy? It'll help take the edge off and lighten the mood.
MAIN_RGLC_4_19,"...No, thanks."
MAIN_RGLC_4_20,I understand your anxiety over Aemeath's situation. You've always held her dear. But it's taken more out of you than you realize.
MAIN_RGLC_4_21,"Things are best taken one step at a time. The Exostrider hasn't awakened yet. The key is to pace ourselves. Slow and steady, right?"
MAIN_RGLC_4_22,"Okay, you're right. Let's table the Exostrider for now. Let's talk about you, Luuk."
MAIN_RGLC_4_23,I trust Aemeath. What we experienced together proved she was telling me the truth. And there's a connection there I can't ignore.
MAIN_RGLC_4_24,"But you and me? We might be ""strangers in passing who became confidants"" as you put it, but it feels like every conversation we've had just skims the surface."
MAIN_RGLC_4_25,I prefer to know who I'm working with before jumping into something as big as opening the Stridergate. It'll affect the entire Lahai-Roi region.
MAIN_RGLC_4_26,Hehe. Point taken. It seems a proper introduction is long overdue.
MAIN_RGLC_4_27,"Please, ask me anything. I'll answer as candidly as I can."
MAIN_RGLC_4_28,Are you a Consultant from the Black Shores?
MAIN_RGLC_4_29,"That, I am not. Work that leaves documented trails doesn't suit my style. But I am acquainted with quite a few Bloom Bearers."
MAIN_RGLC_4_30,"Aemeath said she didn't know you well, but that I could trust you. You also know about the bond between me and her. How?"
MAIN_RGLC_4_31,"Aemeath is a sharp girl. Even though you never introduced me to her, she could read between the lines of your actions."
MAIN_RGLC_4_32,"She's a lot like you. Smart, driven, good at bearing burdens. Though she's proven to be even more stubborn than you are."
MAIN_RGLC_4_33,"After you left Lahai-Roi, she came to see me a few times in the name of counseling... to learn about you."
MAIN_RGLC_4_34,You didn't tell her anything.
MAIN_RGLC_4_35,I didn't. You had other tasks for me here in Lahai-Roi. You didn't let us properly get to know each other because you wanted to shield her from my line of work.
MAIN_RGLC_4_36,She later stopped these visits after realizing that.
MAIN_RGLC_4_38,One last question.
MAIN_RGLC_4_39,"What do you mean by ""I had other tasks for you""?"
MAIN_RGLC_4_40,"That is a key topic, but not suitable for discussion here."
MAIN_RGLC_4_41,The Spacetrek Collective is backed by a number of different nations and powers. Their internal politics are of no concern to us. There are many watching eyes among the support staff.
MAIN_RGLC_4_42,"The infirmary is, after all, a public space. Why don't we take this somewhere more private?"
MAIN_RGLC_4_43,To where?
MAIN_RGLC_4_44,"I have a place in mind. Just come with me, golden {Male=boy;Female=girl}."
MAIN_RGLC_4_45,"More personal business to attend to again, Dr. Herssen?"
MAIN_RGLC_4_46,"Shh, just a quick break, N.A.N.A. Mind holding down the fort? The next shift will be here soon."
MAIN_RGLC_4_47,"Take care, Doctor. Do try to return in one piece."
MAIN_RGLC_4_48,"Don't worry, I have {PlayerName} with me today."
MAIN_RGLC_4_49,"Still… I really hoped she would have opened up to me more. You both tend to keep things to yourselves, and that's never good for anyone."
MAIN_RGLC_4_50,"Sigrika seems more relaxed after her counseling session with Luuk Herssen, brushing past you as she leaves to find her friend Nivora.
You have come to the infirmary to discuss the Exostrider plan with Luuk. Frustrated, you refuse the candy he offers and voice your distrust about how much he knows. Luuk smiles, unperturbed, and invites you to a more private location to talk."
MAIN_RGLC_40_1,"Have a seat, Doctor."
MAIN_RGLC_40_2,Shame. I thought {PlayerName} would come with you.
MAIN_RGLC_40_3,{Male=He's;Female=She's} been here before. But things are different now. I prefer not to have {Male=him;Female=her} tangled in the Collective's trivial matters.
MAIN_RGLC_40_4,Fair enough. But I'm not like those stubborn old goats you're used to dealing with. I don't chase after pride or rank. All I care about is Startorch Academy.
MAIN_RGLC_40_5,"Now go on. Give me the highlights, Dr. Herssen."
MAIN_RGLC_40_6,"The Fractsidus. Hmm, I understand. I'll keep a closer watch."
MAIN_RGLC_40_7,"As for piloting the Exostrider, if {PlayerName} is capable, that's fine by me. The Research Institute will see to the preparations."
MAIN_RGLC_40_8,"That said, we can't ignore the risks that come with opening the Stridergate. I have someone in mind who could help. But first, let me have a quick word with her."
MAIN_RGLC_40_9,The Threnodian concerns every one of us at Lahai-Roi. I'll handle the board as you've asked. You focus on {PlayerName} and the matters here on campus.
MAIN_RGLC_40_10,"Thank you for your understanding, Lucilla—President."
MAIN_RGLC_40_11,Our conversation went more smoothly than I expected. I thought you might think I had a hidden agenda.
MAIN_RGLC_40_12,"As a thank you, care for some candy?"
MAIN_RGLC_40_13,I'll pass. I'm well aware of your candy outreach program across campus. I've had my fill of sweets over the years.
MAIN_RGLC_40_14,As for what you said earlier. I've been here long enough to know exactly who you are.
MAIN_RGLC_40_15,"Thanks to your efforts in uncovering those moles, the Academy is safer, and we have far fewer headaches to worry about."
MAIN_RGLC_40_16,What truly surprised us was your choice to stay all these years and become one of Lahai-Roi's steadfast guardians.
MAIN_RGLC_40_17,"Oh, I'm just glad the President doesn't see me as some busybody."
MAIN_RGLC_40_18,Heh. You're the right kind of busybody. The kind we're happy to have.
MAIN_RGLC_40_19,"A friend of mine sold me on this place. Went on and on about the beautiful snow and the bright, passionate students. Convinced me to come."
MAIN_RGLC_40_20,"But when I actually got here? Heh, nothing like the brochure {Male=he;Female=she} described. Turns out, eight out of ten staff members were planted here by different factions!"
MAIN_RGLC_40_21,"Our students dream of reaching the stars, all while living in a gilded cage. Meanwhile, we have Roya dealing in Exoswarm parts and colluding with New Federation smugglers."
MAIN_RGLC_40_22,"I know that these students aren't fools. They're the best minds from across the nations. If even I can see what's going on, how could they be blind to it?"
MAIN_RGLC_40_23,"It's their ideals, their hope for the future that lets them endure the ugly realities of this place without becoming cynical."
MAIN_RGLC_40_24,I only came to Lahai-Roi because a friend recommended it. But now—
MAIN_RGLC_40_25,"Now you've grown to like it here, right?"
MAIN_RGLC_40_26,"Haha, yes. Same as you, Madam President!"
MAIN_RGLC_40_27,An urgent transmission from N.A.N.A.? If you'll excuse me.
MAIN_RGLC_40_28,Dr. Herss... *static*... en. There was a break-in at the... infirmary.
MAIN_RGLC_40_29,Nivora's been kidnapped... by the one we previously detained... *static*... Warren.
MAIN_RGLC_40_30,What is your status? Are you severely damaged?
MAIN_RGLC_40_31,No need... to worry. Just need... time to repair.
MAIN_RGLC_40_32,Understood. Prioritize damage control after this call. Notify the Academy's security department.
MAIN_RGLC_40_33,It'll take time for them to respond. I'll go after Warren. Which direction did he take her?
MAIN_RGLC_40_34,Received... *static*... message from the Academy. They're heading towards the SkyArk Space Station in the frostlands.
MAIN_RGLC_40_35,(It's the Court of Savantae space station {PlayerName} and I discovered before.)
MAIN_RGLC_40_36,I'm on my way.
MAIN_RGLC_40_37,Warren has escaped. He's taken a student and is heading for one of the debris fields in the frostlands.
MAIN_RGLC_40_38,What do you plan to do?
MAIN_RGLC_40_39,I'm going after him. I'd like you to set up a perimeter there to cut off his escape and prevent any further risks to the Academy.
MAIN_RGLC_40_40,You want me to secure a perimeter while you go in alone to handle Warren?
MAIN_RGLC_40_41,I have a... hypothesis. One I'd like to verify by myself.
MAIN_RGLC_40_42,"Very well. Your track record warrants it. Go, Dr. Herssen, I'll expect good news."
MAIN_RGLC_40_43,"Luuk convinces Lucilla to let you try to pilot the Exostrider once it awakens, while she handles the board.
Midway through their talk, an urgent call comes from N.A.N.A. at the infirmary informing Luuk that the detained Warren has kidnapped Nivora and is heading for the SkyArk Space Station. Luuk prepares to go, securing Lucilla's permission to scout the interior alone first."
MAIN_RGLC_5_1,Sundermere?
MAIN_RGLC_5_2,"Yes. I keep a ""small workspace"" of my own here."
MAIN_RGLC_50_1,The rest is in my study. Shall we?
MAIN_RGLC_6_1,Leave them to me. Let's not waste any more time.
MAIN_RGLC_7_1,"The Exostrider's sword emits a unique frequency. It shields my ""workspace"" from most long-range detection methods."
MAIN_RGLC_7_2,You picked a good spot.
MAIN_RGLC_8_1,Quite a stash.
MAIN_RGLC_8_2,Heh. This is what a secret room is about.
MAIN_RGLC_8_3,"Now, where were we?"
MAIN_RGLC_8_4,"Let's start with the conclusion, before we get into all the details: You asked me to come to Lahai-Roi to watch for any Fractsidus activity."
MAIN_RGLC_8_5,"Warren was the first Fractsidus mole you uncovered, and he certainly won't be the last."
MAIN_RGLC_8_6,Think of the Spacetrek Collective as a web of competing powers. It's as much a haven of independence as a playground for agendas.
MAIN_RGLC_8_7,"An isolated polar region, rich with Exoswarm and the potential for technological breakthrough. Lahai-Roi is a gold mine."
MAIN_RGLC_8_8,Even for the Fractsidus.
MAIN_RGLC_8_9,You're saying the fall of Helios wasn't their real goal?
MAIN_RGLC_8_10,"It was one of several. After your journey in Huanglong and Rinascita, I'm sure you've come to realize their true aim."
MAIN_RGLC_8_11,The Threnodian. Aleph-1.
MAIN_RGLC_8_12,"Correct. Given the Threnodian's unique nature, it's sure to catch their attention. Moreover, Aleph-1 is closely linked to the Stridergate, which may be our ticket to outer space."
MAIN_RGLC_8_13,Spying on the Fractsidus is risky. Why would I have chosen you for this task?
MAIN_RGLC_8_14,"Well, that is a bit of a long story."
MAIN_RGLC_8_15,"Luuk reveals that his presence in Lahai-Roi was arranged by your past self, a move connected to the Fractsidus."
MAIN_RGLC_9_1,"You've always preferred to see things for yourself. Please, follow me to that table."
MAIN_RGLC_9031_1,Urgh... My head's spinning...
MAIN_RGLC_9031_2,"No, not now. I have to finish my thesis... I can faint after the paper's done!"
MAIN_RGLC_9032_1,Let's see here. Who's still skipping their physical check-up...
MAIN_RGLC_9032_2,Do these people not believe in a proper work-life balance?! So irresponsible!
MAIN_RGLC_17_1,(Nivora... Why now?)
MAIN_RGLC_18_1,I know you've been here before! Take me to the data room. Now!
MAIN_RGLC_18_2,Ugh! Okay… I'll-I'll do anything you say.
MAIN_RGLC_18_3,(They're heading deeper into the station. Is there some place we haven't discovered yet?)
MAIN_RGLC_19_1,"(The researchers the Academy stationed here. Two with gunshot wounds, but still alive. And this one... No vitals.)"
MAIN_RGLC_19_2,Luuk stops to administer basic first aid and report the situation to Startorch Academy.
MAIN_RGLC_19_3,(Their bleeding's stopped. I should keep going after Warren.)
MAIN_RGLC_20_1,(Spacial anomalies... Did someone reactivate the SkyArk System?)
MAIN_RGLC_22_1,(It appears Warren's taken Nivora to the data room we visited earlier...)
MAIN_RGLC_23_1,I'll get out of Lahai-Roi! Out of this cursed place!
MAIN_RGLC_26_1,(The path is blocked. It's those Error Modules again... I should use the Adapter.)
MAIN_RGLC_27_1,"(Heh. Almost there. Now, moment of truth.)"
MAIN_RGLC_41_1,(It's cleared. Gotta keep moving.)
Luuk_Shengtai_1_2,{PlayerName}? What a rare guest. Are you just stopping by... or did you come seeking an old friend?
Luuk_Shengtai_1_3,I was just stopping by.
Luuk_Shengtai_1_4,I came to see you.
Luuk_Shengtai_1_5,"Your timing couldn't be better. I've just filed the week's medical records and was mulling over what to do next. A book or my student's suggestion—It's sprouting season, you see. Perhaps a stroll would be nice?"
Luuk_Shengtai_1_6,"Before coming to the Academy, where did you travel to?"
Luuk_Shengtai_1_7,"Before this? Quite a few. There was an observatory up north. Freezing cold at night, but the view of the river of stars stretching across the dome was not to be missed for the world."
Luuk_Shengtai_1_8,"I also stayed in a coastal city, where salty breezes blew through the year. I learned how to brew wine with golden berries… Unfortunately, it turned out far too sweet for my taste, so I gifted the entire batch to my neighbors instead."
Luuk_Shengtai_1_9,See? You have to see the world before you find your stops.
Luuk_Shengtai_1_10,"That's how I feel now. Life at the Academy is peaceful. The students can be a handful sometimes, but I'd never change their vibrant spirits. To be able to share a casual conversation with you like this... I couldn't feel more at home."
Luuk_Shengtai_1_11,I'm glad to hear that.
Luuk_Shengtai_1_12,"Yes... It's a long life. A new season is only beginning. So many possibilities lie ahead, within reach. Sprouting trees, melting snow. Little changes like these... They're signs."
Luuk_Shengtai_1_13,"By the way, I'm usually here. Whenever you're tired, bored… or just need someone to talk to, come find me."
Luuk_Shengtai_1_14,"After all, even when we're talking about such small nothings, we'd find ourselves healing."
Luuk_Shengtai_2_1,{PlayerName}? How are you doing? Still busy saving the world?
Luuk_Shengtai_2_2,I'm doing fine. Not too busy.
Luuk_Shengtai_2_3,Too many things on my plate…
Luuk_Shengtai_2_4,That's good to hear. Keeping your own pace matters.
Luuk_Shengtai_2_5,Then it sounds like it's time you gave yourself a proper break.
Luuk_Shengtai_2_6,"In fact, you're not alone. I meant to tidy up my room once I wrapped up my work… but somehow, one thing after another kept getting in the way."
Luuk_Shengtai_2_7,I suppose that's just life. Plans rarely keep up with change. All we can really do is find a way to breathe comfortably in the spaces between the chaos.
MAIN_RGLC_31_1,"Oh, Doctor..."
MAIN_RGLC_31_2,"I'm afraid ""identity theft"" is not in the curriculum."
MAIN_RGLC_31_3,Isn't that right?
MAIN_RGLC_31_4,"Since you insist on playing the student, I'll offer a lesson."
MAIN_RGLC_31_5,It takes two to play a game.
MAIN_RGLC_31_6,How mean. Is that any way to treat a student?
MAIN_RGLC_31_7,Grand Architect of the Fractsidus.
Luuk_Shengtai_1_15,"I hope you have a happy, fulfilling day, {Male=golden boy;Female=golden girl}."
